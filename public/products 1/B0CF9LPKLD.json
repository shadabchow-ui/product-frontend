        "body": "Classy and comfortable navy blue dress! It wasn't a very dark navy blue, but I didn't need that this time, so it worked for me. It was very comfortable to wear and easy to travel with. I somewhat carelessly tossed it in the suitcase and quickly steamed it in the hotel room, and within minutes, I was ready to go! The top didn't slip down (I believe there's a silicone-type strip on the inside at the top for grip), which kept the top secure for the evening. The sheer top layer looks beautiful and gives it a more formal feel than if it were simply a \"fitted\" dress. It's comfortable on the body; I didn't feel uncomfortable after I ate dinner because it's not a bodycon dress in that way. It's flatteringly fitted, the sheer layer covers any \"food baby\", and is very comfortable. Read more",

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the price - 10 stars!",
        "body": "I haven't had time to write a review in a long time, but I made time for this one. Initially I was a little miffed at the $49 price tag since you never know what you're going to get online but...I had been in search of a black strapless dress for the better part of 10 years. Yep, 10 years. The issue was that every time I found one online it was more of the body con, super tight around the rear, sort of trashy looking, nothing you could wear to a nice formal wedding or party. I had zero hopes for this dress but I put it on and the first words out of my mouth were OMG. The sheer over-layer makes it formal and different. Note that the hem on the black one does not appear like the picture (sort of choppy/or cut off) it's actually a thick double sewn hem that looks even better and more finished, almost like a ribbon from far. It fits perfectly in the top and then the bottom skims out and goes to flowy but not too much fabric that can sometimes make you look larger. Here's all my \"for reference\" info: I ordered an XS because XXS was out of stock and I'm so glad I got XS. I'm 5'2\" and 104. I may be small but I hold the majority of my weight in my bottom half. I'm a tiny pear that looks like I would weigh about 95 pounds if you just look at my upper body. I'm a 34B and the top fits perfectly and will not slide down. The hips skim the sides and then flow out so that it doesn't cup under your rear. For me, this hides a lot of things and enhances my figure and leg length. I couldn't ask for a better dress silhouette and I think this will look good on every body type. If I had one complaint it would be that there's no tag inside so it took me a bit to figure out front vs back. Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Off Shoulder Formal Sleeveless Cocktail is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Plain Navy Blue, Plain White, Plain Coffee Brown, Royal Blue, Black, Plain Burgundy, Solid Blue. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
