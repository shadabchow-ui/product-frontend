        "body": "Stunning satin dress! The fabric is so silky, comfortable, and a gorgeous rosey red color. I ordered a size small (I’m 5’4”, about 123 lbs, 34d). The dress was just a touch long for me, so I gathered the waist on the opposite side of the cinched string, which made the longer edge fall more flatteringly. I also pinned the straps together at the back to help my chest not feel so loose. It’s easy to wash and steam, and the wrinkles come right out. The fit worked for me, but it was borderline too big; if you’re more petite, this dress might feel a bit baggy. Overall, beautiful piece and great price! Read more",

The fit is spot on—I'm 5'3\" and 160 lbs, and I went with a large, which fits perfectly. It’s not too tight or too loose, just the right balance of comfort and style. The fabric feels great, and it looks even better in person. If you're on the fence, don't hesitate—just buy it! You won’t regret it! Highly recommend! Read more",

        "body": "As someone standing at 4'11\", finding dresses that don't need major alterations is like finding a unicorn - but this satin dress delivered! The adjustable spaghetti straps are a game-changer, making it incredibly easy to customize the length and fit to your exact needs. The satin material drapes beautifully and has that luxurious sheen that makes you feel like a million bucks. I was impressed by how well the fabric holds up - no obvious wrinkles or weird bunching that you sometimes get with cheaper satin dresses. What really sets this dress apart is its versatility. Whether you're 4'11\" like me or much taller, the adjustable design works magic. No need for expensive alterations or settling for an awkward length. The straps can be easily modified to hit at just the right spot for your height. The dress flows gracefully with movement, and the fit is true to size. I especially love how it can be dressed up with heels for special occasions or paired with sandals for a more casual look. Read more",

For reference, I’m curvy, 5’4”, 183 lbs, and wore a size large. It felt roomy with plenty of stretch, and while I did consider trying a medium, I stuck with the large due to time. I really appreciated the adjustable shoulder straps and the ruched side tie. The only difference I noticed was that the side tie sat further to the side on my dress, whereas in the listing photos it looked more toward the front, like a traditional slit. Overall, I was very happy with it and would definitely recommend this dress! Read more",
