        "body": "Beautiful dotted-swiss fabric in a rich berry color with the raised “dots” providing a barely-there lighter shade of color and texture that bring it to life! I ordered according to my bust measurement and it fit perfectly except for the length. I’m 5’3” and hemmed the skirt six inches which brought the hem to just above my toes, clearing my footsteps. Though lightweight flowy fabric, there is a lot of yardage, providing sufficient weight to enhance the design on your body! I had constant compliments all day wearing this dress! Really a lovely dress. One caveat is that the polyester fabric wrinkles more than is convenient, but presses well. Still 5 stars! ⭐️ 🌹 Read more",
