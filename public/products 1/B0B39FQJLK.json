        "body": "This dress is perfectly true to size, comfortable, and beautiful. The color is flawless, and the cut is very flattering for those of us with an hourglass shape. It’s also very light, so great for warm months, in my opinion. It is absolutely not see-through despite being so light, though! There are no pockets, so expect to have a bag with you or pair with a cardigan/blazer with pockets. It’s great for business casual or you can dress it up a bit more with the right blazer, shoes, and accessories. I highly recommend this dress. Read more",

I bought it for a professional event. It goes to my knees and isn’t a low cut or a revealing dress. It isn’t TOO tight either if you size accordingly. It is comfy and stretchy! MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT CAME RIPPED/stitching is undone where the zipper meets the fabric!!!!! Read more",

It was too tight overall for me even though my measurements were included at the top range for this size. The color was a darker color than I needed. The photo appeared to be an ivory or off white, but was more like a dark cream. The fabric was soft with a good amount of stretch. Construction was excellent. Stitching was even with no loose threads. The waist seam was even where it connected with the invisible zipper. For reference. I purchased an XXL. I am 5'2\" tall and the dress a.e to my knees. I have a 45\" busy. 40\" waist, and 50\" hips. The price was right for the quality. Read more",

Great length it’s actually stretchy and I could have went down to a large but I liked the silhouette that just slightly hugged my curves. If you don’t have a lot of curves personally I’d size down. The arm holes are a little bit but just a bit still very comfy and I’m actually going to be ordering in more sizes . Oh yeah it has a full zipper in the back and material although stretchy is still pretty sturdy. Read more",
