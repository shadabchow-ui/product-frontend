        "body": "I ordered this dress along with another dress last minute for our beach dinner while on vacation in Antigua. Honestly, I figured I'd like the other dress better, but boy, was I wrong! The dress looks pretty much as pictured in the listing with exception of the cowl in back, the color... I ordered it in purple... is spot on. Material is nice and flowy, silky to the touch and the dress appears to be made very well. Fits true to size... I am 5'6\", 130lbs, 34C, usually wear an S or size 4 in dresses and this dress fits me like shown on the model. I do wish the cowl in back was a little looser, more voluminous as shown, but it's not a deal breaker. The dress is constructed well, and I have no issues with it staying up. I plan on wearing it without a bra, however, due to the strap in back, it could be worn with the right kind of strapless bra, too. Overall, great little dress for the money, looks much more expensive and honestly, should be... highly recommend! Read more",

When I bought this dress the first time, it was stained really bad, with obvious signs of wear but selling as new condition. I returned in hopes of getting a dress in a new condition but the second dress came in a worse condition than the first. The third dress came clean but the zipper was so hard to use that I gave up. Not even sure it actually works. Glad the elastic around the bust gave room for me to squeeze into the dress, a little too much that you have to keep pulling the dress up.

I don't think you can wear a bra with it based on the low back. This was for my teen who didn't need to wear a bra. This purchase was light blue, but we also bought the navy blue, which I like more.
