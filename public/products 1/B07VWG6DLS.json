        "body": "First off—the color. This deep emerald green is stunning. It’s rich, elegant, and honestly one of those shades that looks amazing under holiday lighting. Against Christmas décor, especially golds and reds, it really pops without being loud. Now let’s talk fit, because this is where the dress really shines. The fabric hugs in all the right places without feeling tight or uncomfortable. It smooths everything out, gives a flattering silhouette, and still lets you move, sit, and breathe—which is non-negotiable for me. The V-neckline is tasteful but feminine, and the wrap-style front gives shape without overexposing anything. The side slit is such a good detail. It adds just enough drama and movement without being too much. You get that confident, elegant vibe when you walk, but it still feels classy and appropriate for a holiday party or formal event. Comfort-wise—this dress is a win. I wore it for hours and never felt like I needed to adjust it or rush home to change. The material has a nice weight to it, so it drapes beautifully and doesn’t cling in a weird way. It feels structured but forgiving, which we love. Overall, this is one of those dresses that makes you feel put together, confident, and festive without trying too hard. It’s perfect for Christmas parties, winter weddings, or any dressy night where you want to feel elegant but still like yourself. Read more",

        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Best dress out of 6 I tried!",
        "body": "This dress fit great unlike other dresses from the same product line. It did have 1 slight issue in the front where the dress sits across cleavage. I did not care because I'd already sent back 4 other dresses and this was a backup! It won't seem very wrinkled but look at it in the light and they're probably present so be sure to steam it before you wear it. It's the type of material that changes color as you steam so you'll need to steam the entire dress, not just the wrinkled areas. I'd like to note that although it's definitely a polyester and you might think how is this cheap material okay for a formal event. Well everyone is wearing it now so you won't stand out as wearing a cheap dress. Once upon a time nicer fabrics for formal dresses were readily available. Sadly this isn't the case. Even department stores are selling this polyester material in their formal wear, so it will do in a pinch and for a dress under $80. I'm 5ft 4inches and with 4inch platform heels it was perfect. If you're my height you'll need at least a 3inch heel. I did notice depending on the style of dress they came in different lengths. This brand is definitely not paying close attention to detail m, however they probably have a dress that will work for you. I tried their scoop neck and that was a nightmare. I also tried the dress that had ruffles only on one shoulder and it drove me nuts just while trying on. If it had the ruffles on both sides I would have been able to ignore it. With just one shoulder have the flutter sleve it made me feel like something was touching me. Another positive about this particular dress is that it did not go down it the back so much that my bra showed. The \"cleavage\" was minimal so I felt covered enough to still be classy. Note all the photos are from the end of the night. (I'm so bad at remembering to take photos!) Also I know ruching is supposed to camouflage the tummy. However Mayne I could have fit a size S so it wouldn't be so loose across the tummy. That's my major complaint with the dress and I remembered as I posted these photos. It doesn't look as flattering as it did earlier in the night as well. Perhaps it both stretched out and I could have worn a size S. Although my boobs probably wouldn't fit right in the S. I'm a bit embarrassed by the photos but wanted to show the dress. It's not like this is social media right. 😆 Anyways hopefully the pics show that the dress is a bit modest adjacent especially for the style. The slit isn't to high and makes you feel a bit sexy! I did pink with Navy blue because I found out the theme was spring. So added some spring pink with a purse and shoes. Oh the heels are dream pairs. They're so very comfortable too! I have a bad ankle and could wear then with my brace! This dress was the winner out of 6 dresses I tried! Oh, I'm 5ft 4in, 34 DDD (the dress wasn't too tight in chest,) 39 inch hip. I got the size M. I hope this helps! Read more",
