        "body": "Excellent buy for the money. Very happy with this purchase. I am 5’4” and weigh 105 lbs. I bought the yellow XS and was pleased with the fit and length. I did not find this item to be see through, but I also did not wear black undies so maybe I didn’t put it to “the test,” but I feel common sense is warranted here. I wore this to my son’s wedding in September. The fabric weight was perfect summer weather. I got lots of compliments on the simple style of the dress and how it looked like it could be relaxed or refined depending on the accents and occasion. All in all, I would buy this again in another color if I have another event in the future. I’ll keep this one too for future things. Read more",

        "body": "The perfect wedding guest dress! The length and fit is perfect. Minus one star because there was a small snag in the fabric that caused a line in the dress. If you are a slouchy girl like me, you have to sit up straight with your shoulders back in order for the straps to stay up. If you slouch, the straps will fall off your shoulders which can be annoying. The dress is not very stretchy but is very comfortable. The low back is stunning and I loved dancing the night away in this gown! Read more",

I love the olive colored one but the pink was longer and the top was fitted but would dip and there would definitely be a nip slip if I ever wore this in public. Strange that they are not the same but maybe it will work for someone else. The material was nice to the touch and looks nice and the pink is gorgeous but I had to unfortunately return it. The Olive dress is stunning though and I feel a lot more secure in the top area! Read more",

I just wore pasties underneath, it is open in the back but has a tie to secure it. Straps are adjustable. It feels similar to other bridesmaid dresses I have, the quality is great. The photos make it look more blue, the mirror pics are more color accurate. It is definitely more teal-blue. Read more",

BUT and this is a MAJOR but… the straps fall down like literally every 2 seconds no matter how you adjust them. Even if you’re just standing there doing nothing. They’re like stitched too close to your armpits. I was planning to wear it to a wedding but had to return because I don’t want a strap falling down and a booby coming out while I’m walking down the aisle or getting low on the dancefloor. It’s very boobilicious would definitely need like some fabric tape to keep the fabric up by the boobs. Im a size large, I’m curvy with a big butt, 38C and I ordered a large it did fit. Read more",

Again the color was off (beige not mocha). I kept and wore the beige and it worked just fine, but would have preferred a darker color i.e. mocha.
