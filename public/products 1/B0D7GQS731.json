Dress is super pretty and was comfy but the top did keep riding up which was annoying. I'm a 36D and could have used more coverage but whatever. It's a little sheer too. Is it worth the price? Honestly the fabric isn't in my opinion. It doesn't look cheap or anything but it doesn't feel luxurious. You're paying for the cut. I have a really long torso and I haven't found any other drop waist dresses that go this low which is really flattering for pregnancy. Read more",

However, i did buy this on sale (DO NOT buy this full price) and with the intention of wearing it as a housework/ running errands outfit so its sloppy design doesnt bother me as much. Overall, if you are buying this with the hopes of a simple chic dress for a special event please please PLEASE dont waste your money on full price. P.S this is not short girl friendly.

The fabric flowed beautifully in the breeze and looked stunning against the natural backdrop exactly the dreamy, ethereal look I was going for. The material is soft and stretchy, with just enough weight to drape nicely without feeling heavy. It highlighted my bump in the most elegant way, and the photos turned out magical. I received so many compliments! Highly recommend this dress for any maternity shoot, especially outdoors. It made me feel beautiful and confident everything a mama to be could want! Read more",
