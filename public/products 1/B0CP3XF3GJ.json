        "body": "Bought this to wear to a family event that had a Lavender/Purple color theme. I had tried it on and it fit perfectly in XL (I'm 5'6 185lbs). Its was flowy with a nice outer material and just the right length with heels or flats (shorter individuals may find it too long. The underlay was a different material with stretch and gave you a shape so the dress wouldn't look like a trash bag or curtain, but if you get a lighter color it may show some lumps and bumps, nothing shape wear couldn't smooth right out. The dress is flattering and the halter style top made it really cute. Con: Unfortunately, I didn't get to wear the dress because I didn't pack the right bra to wear...just assumed a strapless bra would work. All strapless bras are not created equal. Mine showed under the arm very prominently and the underlay did not cover the bulge at the top of my bra or the outline of the bra...all this was very noticeable through the outer fabric material. So, I went with my back up. I only returned it bc it was color specific and not something I would wear continuously. I may consider black and have it as a go-to for formal occasions. (Not a casual dress IMO). Read more",
