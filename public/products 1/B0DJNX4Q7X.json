        "body": "I LOVE THIS DRESS! It is the same color as shown, and it fits my 5'10\" 245lb self great! I got the XXL. It's very flattering and very comfortable! I'm very sensitive to \"itchy\" materials, but I don't feel that at all in this dress. I wore it to a friend's rehearsal dinner and will be wearing it to another wedding. It doesn't wrinkle super easy which I love. The entire dress has fabric underneath it, so it's only sheer past my knees. It's stretchy and comfortable around the bust area, which is so nice! I wear a 40G and I feel covered and not exposed at all. I want to get this dress in another color! It feels a little expensive (I'm very cheap), but it's so worth the money. It's a great dress!

Sleeves do not pinch and are comfortable. It has a modest bust area, which I appreciated. I definitely recommend this dress, and there was actually another guest at the wedding wearing the light pink version of this same dress. It looked great on her too! Unfortunately the only full body picture I got, I had people standing in front of me, so you cant see the dress well. But it really is very beautiful and suitable for all body sizes and shapes!

        "body": "Picture the pre-wedding frenzy: my 5-year-old son zooming around with a lightsaber like a tiny Jedi, knocking over chairs, while the whole clan’s buzzing, preparing for his older brother's wedding—I’m helping him while thinking about my wife’s nerves over looking just right as mother of the groom. She slips into this PRETTYGARDEN smocked midi tulle dress, square neck popping with those puffy sleeves, and whoa—suddenly she’s twirling like a vision, all worries gone. Boy, in our chaotic household, it screamed “easy elegance” without the fuss. Pros: * Flowy tulle tiers swish beautifully, lightweight polyester shell keeps it airy for summer events—my wife danced through the reception without overheating, unlike stiffer formal gowns we’ve eyed before. * Smocked bodice stretches comfy for real curves; she felt secure and flattering with her bust and tummy, true to size (we grabbed medium for her US 8-10 frame). * Lined for modesty, machine-washable ease—handled family photos and hugs without snags or itch, way softer than scratchy laces from other brands. * Versatile vibe: heels for the ceremony, flats for cake-cutting; that romantic silhouette turned heads at the wedding. Cons: * Sleeves can slip on shoulders during excited hugs—nitpicky, but she tugged ’em up mid-toast. * Runs a tad big in the bust for petite frames; my wife safety-pinned once for extra hold. * Wrinkles from packing—steamer fixed it quick, but arrived a bit rumpled. * Tulle layers add subtle volume; fine for most, but watch if you hate anything poofy. Pro tip: Steam before wearing to fluff the ruffles, and size down if between for a snugger smock—pairs great with simple jewelry to let the dress shine. After the big day, this dress was her confidence booster—transformed mom-anxiety into fabulous memories, one ruffled step at a time. Read more",
