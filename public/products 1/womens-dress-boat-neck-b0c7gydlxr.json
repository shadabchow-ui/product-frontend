        "body": "This sweater is gorgeous. It is very unique and has a beautiful drape. I received so may compliments on it. I can see this at a high end store, the fabric is not cheap. One word of advise for my tall girls out there. I would say order a size up because the sweater is asymmetrical at the hem. Because of the batwing, when you lift your arms up to hug someone, the shorter side will go up to your ribcage. The sweater is quite voluminous so this could add more fabric bulk so use your best judgement here... ie- too much sweater fabric vs. potential sweater rise. Either way, not a deal breaker for me and I am ordering in another color. I got a medium in red. I'm 5'8\" about 145 lbs and it fit great. The red is a vibrant cherry red. Very pretty and perfect for the holidays... Read more",

        "body": "A beautiful off-the-shoulder sweater that I had high hopes for, and while the quality is fantastic, I ultimately decided to return it. Here’s my take on it: Quality and Comfort: The sweater is made from a really nice, soft material that feels great against the skin. It has a good weight to it, making it perfect for cooler weather. The craftsmanship is excellent, with neat stitching and no loose threads—definitely a high-quality piece. Style: The off-the-shoulder design is lovely and trendy, offering a relaxed yet chic look. Unfortunately, I realized that this style just isn’t for me. While it looked good, I didn't feel entirely comfortable wearing it off the shoulder at my age, which is why I decided to return it. That said, if you love the off-the-shoulder look, this sweater would be a great addition to your wardrobe! Final Thoughts: Even though it wasn’t the right fit for my style, I can’t fault the sweater itself. If you're into off-the-shoulder designs, I think you'll love it. The quality and softness are top-notch, but it just didn’t work for me personally. Returning was an easy process, though, which I appreciated! Read more",

        "body": "This has got to be the weirdest looking sweater I've ever seen, but so cute once you put it on. For reference I'm 5'4, 140 lbs, with a large bust (34DDD) and the small fits perfect. Luckily it has a tag on the inside so you know where your head goes cause without it I wouldn't be able to tell...lol. It's very flattering on the body. There's plenty of room in the arms due to the bat wing design but it's still fitted around the waist to make you look slim. The bottom hem can be worn straight across or at an angle. I love that it can be worn with jeans or dress pants depending on the look your going for. Already ordering it in another color. Read more",

This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
