        "body": "I LOVE THIS DRESS!! The color is fab and the fabric is thick and definitely bodycon style. It’s a bit pricey but i would say that it is worth it. I needed a red dress for my cruise and this one worked the best. It's classy, sassy and very flattering; I want more colors. I am typically a size sm/md (4), 5'4, 34DD, I’m busty but not super shapely...(more like and inverted triangle) and the small fit perfect. I ordered medium first and felt like it wasn't holding me in tight enough and the straps were a little too loose , but the small fits like a glove and is extremely comfortable. I want it in more colors. I have some complaints about seller/shipping issues; one of the sizes I ordered must have been returned by someone else because it reeked of fabric softener and was likely washed and the seller also sent me a totally different dress when I ordered the small.

        "body": "I absolutely love this dress. Because it looks more expensive than it actually is. The quality is great, it feels a little on the heavy side but I like that it didn’t make me hot I wore it in Florida weather. It’s very stretchy, hugs every curve. The color is actually a little more like a coral/blush but it’s very pretty and it was perfect for what I was looking for. I’m small on top and bigger on the bottom. It offers a lot of support on topics it doesn’t have any padding so if you have nothing up there is will show. I used inserts that stick on to make that look better since I’m not gifted on that department. I didn’t want the bra to show and it worked perfectly for me. I usually have a problem clothes fitting my big around the waist but this was a good fit. The hip area was also stretchy enough so I was able to move around and didn’t feel like it would ride up. The length was good for me because I didn’t want it to be too short witch made it appropriate for a wedding and I felt comfortable wearing it. The zipper worked very smooth and I will definitely be buying more from this brand. I’m 5’4 and I weight 138lbs I ordered a small and I’m happy with my purchase Read more",

I work for my bachelorette neon themed night and it was a complete hit. I didn’t feel like it was gonna break and the zipper was beautiful. It even has a top class but like keeps everything together. If I had a complaint, the only thing would be is that I can’t wear a bra with it. My chest is a little on the larger side, but with some adequately placed boob tape you wouldn’t even noticed.

I got the last one in my size and the color I wanted, so finding a replacement wasn't happening. Amazon can't through with making everything right, because they're awesome like that. When I left for my anniversary getaway without this spectacular dress, I was pretty disappointed and then halfway to our destination when I received the notice it would be delivered at my home that day... Life happens and AGAIN, Amazon rocked. I had to wear a different dress, but it's okay, because I have this one now and it fits like it was truly made for me. For reference, I'm 5'8\", 140lbs, measurements are : Bust: 34DD Waist: 28 Hips: 37 The dress, the color the material are EVERYTHING! The picture shows the true color of the dress.

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Bodycon is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",
