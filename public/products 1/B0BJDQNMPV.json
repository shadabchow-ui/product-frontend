        "body": "I got a small based on reading reviews of others with a smaller bust size, and that was a good call. I'm 5'7\" and smaller on top, and a small fit me great. I wasn't worried very much about it falling down since there is a rubber strip at the top which helps the top stay on and feel secure. The light blue color was beautiful, and the material felt great. I do wish it was a tad bit longer, but it's a small nitpick for something that overall looks great, makes me feel great, and wasn't too expensive. Overall had a great night partying in this dress and will be keeping it for future events! Read more",

The dress is super flattering and tight in the right places. It will show sweat if you sweat so beware of the under “chest” sweat if you don’t wear a bra. It’s nice that the top is snug enough to stay up but also not giving that armpit overhang. Really beautiful!! Read more",

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Solid dress for any occasion! 10/10!",
        "body": "A little over a year ago, I ordered this dress in burnt orange and fell in love with it so much that I ordered the dress again in olive green. Overall rating - 10/10 - and here is why.... Material / Feel: The dress has a simple elegance / classy look to it and you can certainly dress it up or down depending on the occasion you wear it for. The material and quality are just like similar dresses I've seen / received from other brands that sell it for 2x the price, so you are better off getting it from here and saving some money! Fitting / Sizing: Compared to other strapless dresses I own, it is more snug across the chest area, but I actually prefer that a lot because it keeps the ladies secured all night and minimizes the fidgeting / readjusting. It also has a sticky lining across the top, so braless or not, it gives a bit of extra security to keep the ladies in check. I fluctuate between c / d cup, so anything in this size or bigger, I recommend wearing either a strapless bra or tapping / cupping the ladies up to avoid having flattened chest - it may look good from the frontal view, but the side view paints a different picture. If you go braless (for any size cup) / wear it on a cold night / or easily get perky, you may want to consider tapping the nips ... I learned the hard way from a group wedding photo that will forever be documented. For reference, I ordered the orange dress for a wedding in a Large (5'5\", 36D, 30W, 40H - 165lbs) and it fit great. I've lost weight since and ordered the green dress in a Medium (5'5\", 34C/36D, 27/28W, 37/38H - 135lbs) and again, fits great. Despite losing the weight though, I tried both on the other day for comparison and I can honestly wear either size depending on the fit I want. If I want more of a flowy, less fitted dress that doesn't confirm to my curves / body, I would wear the Large. Still held the girls in and looked great on. If I want a fitted dress that hugs my body and makes it a bit sexier / less casual (IMO), I would wear my recommended sizing - Medium. So depending on your measurements and the fit you are trying to achieve, you can order your recommended sizing OR size up. Read more",

I like that the top stayed up the whole time while dancing and I got lots of compliments on how the dress was so cute so overall it was a cute dress that fit well but it was a little cheap.

The zipper is easy to use and it does have a little bit of stretch. More stretch up top and not so much the body of the dress. She sad it's a little bigger on top for her since she’s not big chested but she’s still able to keep it up. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Maxi is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",

Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory.
