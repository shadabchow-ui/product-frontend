        "body": "I am not a huge fan of corduroy, but I decided to give this dress a try because I love the utility yet stylish look. I am so glad I did! The style and cut of the dress are very flattering, with the belt that cinches the waist a bit. I also love that the dress is a little bit shorter than most dresses I own. I am petite, 4‘11“ and every dress goes to my knees or longer. This one is a couple inches above the knee and Although it has a collar and short sleeves, it does look sexy and has the zipper option to show a little cleavage or cover the chest. I also thought it was going to be heavy and very thick, but it is not. It is right in the middle and I ended up getting a black and a white one. I think my favorite is the black. The white one fits a little bigger in the shoulders and neck area so I’m still contemplating returning it. My recommended size was a small and it does work, but it’s a little roomy. I am also small chested so if you have a bigger bust, you may want to size up a little. Read more",
