        "body": "I was pleasantly surprised by how much I love this dress! I’m 5’7” and 135 lbs, and Amazon recommended sizing up to a medium. I usually wear a small, but I’m glad I followed their advice — the medium fits perfectly! The fabric feels high-quality, and it even has a lining so it’s not sheer. It’s soft, comfortable, and drapes nicely. I love the pockets! I ordered the orange color, and it’s gorgeous — perfect for fall. Overall, great quality and super flattering.

        "body": "This is a good quality dress for the price, I would say it’s worth the buy. According to the size chart I should’ve purchased a large (5’7, 175lb, 31” waist) but went with a medium to have a slightly more fitted look to the waist and it was perfect! The dress has an inner lining that does not bunch up or feel rough or uncomfortable. This dress is also accommodating if you’re bustier (I’m a 32G/H). I chose this for my new hostess job because I wanted something modest but not matronly. I find this is cute with chelsea boots or oxfords, and fishnet or sheer tights pair well. The pockets are a great size, will fit a larger phone. Overall I’d say it’s a pretty wallet friendly but well made dress. I recommend hang drying & perhaps a steam in the bathroom while you shower to loosen some creases from being packaged up Read more",

        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty dress, liked it a lot.",
        "body": "This is a very pretty dress and flattering even for hour glass shapes that are a bit top heavy. I always order based upon the seller’s size chart rather than Amazon’s suggested size. In this case, the size I ordered was true to size. I would have given it 4 stars if the lining was not slightly smaller than the dress. In me, it looked fine, but it felt snug across the bust. It’s an easy thing to rectify- wear a mini mixer bra or lose 5 lbs. But if you are in between sizes, determine how you want it to fit. If I would have gone up a size the larger size would have been 2-3 inches too big. Therefore, I am keeping the dress. The fabric is a looser cotton weave. The pattern is pretty, and subtle. The fabric itself is a lighter weight material. The comfort is amazing and I see why buyers have purchased in multiple colors. I could see myself wearing this on a hot day where I want to look put together but desire cool and comfort. Add sandals and a rattan bag for a boho feel. It can be classed up with a pointed toe flat, a cute east west handbag and some pearls. I also love that it is modest. I hate how so many things think all women want tight, cropped, short, plunging necklines etc. This dress hit me right below my calf on my 5’5” frame. A fashion hack that makes styling look polished is choosing a skirt length that makes your legs look slim. Thus skirts look best at the leg’s narrow point—ankles, below the knee, below the calf. I do think this dress will require some care. Delicate washing in a mesh bag, cold cycle. Line drying and steaming or ironing to look it’s best. But the shape is forgiving enough that it can be packed for travel. For the price point the quality is good to above average. It’s a dupe for Anthropologie and similar shape to J.Crew which makes it seem more lux. I would recommend it to a friend. Read more",

The fabric is high quality, has some weight to it and doesn't have that poly feel that many of the amazon dresses seem to have now. It looks classy and I love the length. It fit true to size and is flattering on me even though I'm not thin. The skirt is lined. I liked it so much that I purchased it in rose pink which I actually wore to our event. This fall I've worn this to a nicer dinner/concert and to sing on the platform in church. Got several compliments on it. Perfect dress for summer/fall at a reasonable price. Read more",

        "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars What were they thinking with the POLYESTER lining??",
        "body": "This is a beautiful cotton dress....that is until you put it on and get encased in POLYESTER! I think that most people would buy this dress for the fact that is advertised as a light and breezy cotton summer dress. Why in the world would they decide to ruin it and add the enormous amount of polyester lining?? The entire dress is lined with the polyester on the inside and when you put it on, all you'll feel is sticky hot plastic. It completelly undoes the outside cotton fabric and feel. Initially I thought I could just cut out the lining and wear it without, but it has the see-through lines and design on it so it would be tough to wear without showing some skin underneath. So I ended up returning this one. Other than the polyester issue, the dress is well made, beautiful true (as in pics) green color, good length for my 5\"8 frame. Sleeves are nice length, they sit flat, and arm openings are right size where they don't show the undergarments but they don't suffocate either. Also the waist is not too tight and it makes it comfortable to wear. This is a particularly flattering fit for apple shape bodies if you get the right size. I did size up on mine because I wanted more room in the chest and that was a good choice. I really wanted to like and keep this dress for all the above reasons hence the 3 stars, but unfortunately just can't come to terms with the ugly lining. If this was just a plain cotton fabric on the outside without the see-through lines, it could have been worn without the lining and would have been really versatile beautiful summer dress.
