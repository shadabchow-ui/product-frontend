The satin fabric is so soft and smooth—it feels luxurious yet comfortable. It ran true to size, which made shopping for it so much easier. The dress fit perfectly, and I didn’t have to worry about adjusting it at all during the event. Not only was it comfortable, but it also looked stunning in photos! It’s the perfect blend of elegant and fun, and I could see myself wearing it for other events as well. I highly recommend this dress if you’re looking for something that’s both flattering and special! Read more",

The material feels so soft and luxe, and once I gave it a quick steam, it looked flawless. The color is everything — rich, elegant, and perfect for date nights, weddings, or any moment you want to feel put-together without trying too hard. If you’re on the fence, this is your sign to grab it. It’s comfortable, flattering, and made me feel so confident all night long. ✨ Read more",

The underarm gaps tremendously- but the other side is perfect! It was so close to being an an amazing dress! The color is gorgeous a little more dusty rose than khaki but attractive. The material is slinky but not terribly thin. If you are a seamstress, u could fix the flaw easily. It would cost me more to have it altered than I paid for it. Also the hemline is straight. It would be more appealing to have a slit up the leg . It's a very basic design so a slit would give it a little flare. So close!😭 Read more",
