        "body": "My fiancé and I are flying to Las Vegas for a wedding. We’re all friends with the groom and the bride isn’t bringing any friends or family (they’re Australian and eloping to be with the groom’s American friends) so the other woman going and I wanted to wear the bride’s colors for support. It seemed sad that the groom is going to have multiple groomsmen and the bride would have nobody. The bride doesn’t know we’re wearing red so we can coordinate with her (she’s painting her nails red -seriously, that’s all she said ). It’s just a fun surprise. So, us “bridesmaids “ had one rule-find something red that worked for a Vegas wedding. The other bridesmaid is wearing a red jumpsuit. I chose this, hoping it would look casual enough to wear around Vegas, but nice enough for a wedding. Ya’ll, it’s PERFECT. Love the red. Fits like an absolute dream on my 5’5” hourglass figure, 177-180 pounds, thick arms and hips, big booty and 36DDD top. It looks classy and can be dressed up (like for a wedding) or down for an everyday maxi dress. The only complaint is the lace in the chest area -I’ll have to wear something underneath for some modesty. A slip would work great. I really love the vibrancy of the red. And this is the first dress with a back zipper I have ever been able to zip up myself. It is sooo pretty and soooo comfortable. Length was perfect for me, floor length, with no shoes so will be fine with flat sandals, though I could get away with a heal with no problem as well. Highly recommend!!! Read more",

        "body": "I'm always hesitant to buy clothes online, but I needed something quick, so I took a shot. I was part of a wedding and needed a blue dress, I looked all over and couldn't find one that fit the bride's specifications. With the wedding only weeks away, I found this beauty online and ordered it (based on other good reviews). It fit like a glove and is super comfortable. I struggle finding clothes that fit me well because I am heavy, but this dress was amazing and was very flattering. Like other reviews have mentioned, the bodice lining has little wholes which are see through (pictured), but this was easily resolved by wearing a slip with the dress. The sleeves are sheer, which made the dress very cool, which was nice because the wedding was outdoors on a hot day. The fabric is light, and the lace is very soft, again, perfect for warm days outside. I'm 5'5 and about 250lbs with a pronounced tummy, and I thought it looked great on me and I received a lot of compliments on the dress. I bought the light blue, and the color was as pictured and exactly what I needed. Read more",

Everything we found was either too tight, too low-cut, or just not elegant enough. After endless Amazon orders and returns, she finally found this one and it feels like such a win. The neckline is modest, the fit is graceful, the material is just as beautiful as the pictures, and the color is absolutely stunning.
