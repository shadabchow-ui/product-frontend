        "body": "A solid 4.5 ⭐. This dress was affordable and cute so I had to give it a try. I am always looking for confortable outfits and this one does not disappoint. But it really depends on your body type and looking at reviews the measurements they put. I'm normall a Medium in GAP, and I sized up to a large. I have 31 inch waist, 41 inch hip and small bust but wider ribcage 37.5 ish. I'm 5'3\" and 155 lbs, my weight distribution is pretty even, I have an athletic body type and my arms have weight to them. So all that to say is I really did not know what to expect. Pro: -The dress material is soft and has some stretch, the black color is classic and the fit is good. -the length is alright not too short and not long, but I'm 5'3, so for me it's a tad long. Some conservative peeps might find this to be the perfect length, but for me, I might just tailor it up and inch. -perfect fall/winter date dress -perfect shopping/city travel dress Con: -The chest and stomach area is fitted, which makes my small chest \"A\" look a bit squeezed in and a bit flatter (but I'll try this dress with a bra and see if that fixes it, although I really want to make this work without a bra, since it's so soft and compressive already). I do have to point out that on my body, despite the more compressive parts of the chest and stomach, it's not uncomfortable, but I can imagine my larger chested girlies finding this to be too tight and \"the girls\" squished in. Overall, small minus, mostly pros, and I will be looking at other colors too! Read more",

        "body": "I share in what other reviewers say about how sturdy the fabric is. This dress does compress well and isn't visually see through. I am, however, returning it for the following reasons: It's not VISUALLY see-through, but the fabric is so tight you can see any shapewear or underwear underneath it, barring maybe like a full unitard, which I don't own. The muffintop at the top of tights would also show :( I can't wear a proper bra, which would be nice at my size and build. The square neckline is very wide and the bra will show no matter what. I do like the styling of a wide neck, and I think it keeps the dress from being too boring, but with how unforgiving the tight fabric is I don't feel confident letting my tig ol biddies do whatever they want. The seem to want to sit in my armpits in this dress. On me, this comes VERY short. XL is my standard size--there was nothing for me to size up to--and I feel like more size options would've made me exchange this instead of returning it. If you're midsized (US size 12) or smaller and comfortable with little-to-no structure underneath,, this is a well-constructed and gorgeous little dress. You should size up for more breathing room! The airy blue is true to color and very feminine and flattering. I'll come back if they ever add more sizes! Read more",

I had very low expectations for it, bc usually how Amazon clothes are pictured vs how they actually are IRL are vastly different. This one is spot-on and so flattering! I think it could be great for all body sizes and a majority of chest sizes (unless you have like super duper huge boobs, but I could be wrong). The square neckline is also surprisingly flattering. I have a small chest (small B cup) and a single mastectomy and it was flattering/ didn’t gap on my flat side. The material is very comfortable, like an athletic dress and the quality of the material was better than expected (again, usually amazons clothing is pretty cheap). The dress has some stretch and the material is not see-through. I sized to a large and I was very comfortable in it (I don’t Iike things super tight). For reference, I am 5’7” and ~140#. I think if I ordered a medium, it would have been ok, but just a little tight in the arms and also possibly a bit too short, as other buyers had mentioned. I definitely can’t recommend this dress enough— I want to buy it in every color! Go on and order one! Read more",
