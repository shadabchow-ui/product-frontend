        "body": "I am so happy to have discovered this lovely dress. It fits my frame nicely and I feel good wearing it. It feels like better quality. I'm 5'6\" and the length on me is just above the knee. The empire waist is flattering for us pear-shaped girls with an average-sized bust line. I can imagine that if you have gigantic b**bs! 😂, you might want to pass on this, because the empire cut and stretchy smocking across the chest will over-emphasize that area and kind of ruin the overall look, IMO. Also, the rounded neckline might be a bit cleavage-y for bigger girls. I love that this is so versatile and can be worn as a casual dress with flats or heels, or as a longer tunic top with leggings. The blousey, fuller sleeves with elastic at the wrists are comfortable and forgiving. And, surprise, the sleeves are even long enough on me! I love the fabric. It has a good weight and thickness and hangs nicely, but is still flowy, soft, and feminine. I'm glad it's not made of that typical, dreaded, butt-clingy T-shirt material or that equally dreaded thin, stretchy knit fabric (aka cheap, fast-fashion) that is so prevalent from clothing sellers. Note: The sizing is equivalent to standard American sizes, so if you typically size up for your Amazon clothing purchases, you won't need to do so for this. OK, now I'm going to order a few more colors! Read more",
