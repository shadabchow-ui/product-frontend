I got both a small & xs in the black, green & red (wine color). The xs worked best. It’s got some stretch to it and the waist & hips looked more streamlined with the smaller size. Zipper is just ok! It’s comfortable to wear and looks so similar to one at Anthropologie. The material used are the same too! It’s 1/3 of the price at Amazon and looks like it cost at least $200. I love how it’s fitted in the bodice then flows from right under waist with the enclosed same material tie belt! This is a favorite buy of mine frequently m Amazon.

The color is just as it appears in the picture and there is some stretch to the material. The sash is long and versatile, so I'm debating tying it in a bow in the back or in the front. I don't think there's a 'right' answer. The cons/concerns: The dress did come wrinkled, since it was vacuum sealed. While I tried to steam it on my own, I felt like I would be doing it for daaaaaaays, so I took it to my dry cleaner. We'll see if they can get creases to come out. Taking it to them automatically doubled the cost of the dress, but I had no other choice. Read more",
