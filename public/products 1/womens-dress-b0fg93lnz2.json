        "body": "Oh my gosh, I love this sweater so much! It's perfect! I love a nice substantial sweater that's warm but that's not scratchy or pokey or squeezy because I have sensory issues and can't stand clothes that make me hyper aware of them (if that makes sense). This is super soft and comfortable, and it fits nicely. It's \"oversized\" but not like crazy big. I usually buy an XL or sometimes even a 2XL in sweaters because I really like a looser fit and the ability to be able to wear one over a short or long-sleeve tee with plenty of room to spare. I got this in an XL and it's exactly what I hoped for. I love this so much I bought it in all the other colors! Read more",

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Pretty & Comfortable!",
        "body": "I am always on the lookout for comfortable sweaters for the winter and this is a good one! First of all, I love that it's a cotton blend sweater, especially since I've been trying to avoid buying polyester whenever possible, so the cotton and recycled polyester blend feels like a win haha! The color is beautiful, a lovely light blue blend, and the fit is perfectly oversized. Most importantly, however, the cotton yarn feels comfortable and breathable against my skin! It's still a nice heavyweight sweater for chilly winter days, definitely too heavy for warmer fall/spring days. The fit feels true to size but with oversize items like this, you'll always have to decide how large you want it to look/feel because it is definitely big. I personally would say size down if you're between sizes but that's based on preference. The sweater itself feels well made and there aren't any wonky seams or loose threads. It's also fully washable! I forget what the directions suggested, but we wash everything in cold water anyway and since I forgot to take it out before throwing everything in the dryer, it also got dried in low heat. It came out great, no shrinking or any other issues!! Definitely recommend this beautiful sweater! Read more",

        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Cozy, Stylish, and Warm Sweater with a Slightly Boxy Fit",
        "body": "The Amazon Essentials Women’s Oversized-Fit Multi-Color Heavyweight Crewneck Sweater is a wonderful find for anyone who loves comfort and warmth during the cooler months. I ordered the size small in the Bright Blue Marl color, and I have to say—the color is absolutely gorgeous. It’s rich, cheerful, and adds a nice pop to any outfit without being overwhelming. The sweater feels thick and cozy, perfect for fall and winter. The material has a soft texture that doesn’t itch, which I really appreciate since I’m sensitive to certain fabrics. It’s warm enough to wear on its own indoors but also layers nicely under a coat for outdoor use. The stitching feels durable, and the overall construction gives the impression of quality. As the description says, it has an oversized fit, so it hangs loosely around the shoulders and torso. It’s great for a relaxed, casual look, but if you prefer something more fitted, you might consider sizing down. For me, the small was still quite roomy, though very comfortable for lounging or pairing with jeans and boots. One of my favorite details is the blend of colors in the fabric. The marl pattern gives it dimension and makes it look more interesting than a solid-color sweater. It feels effortlessly stylish while remaining simple enough for everyday wear. My only small critique is that because it’s a heavyweight knit, it can feel a bit bulky when layered under a tighter jacket. However, that’s a minor issue given how warm and soft it is. Overall, this sweater is a great addition to my wardrobe. It’s perfect for cozy days at home, casual outings, or layering for colder weather. I love the color, the softness, and the quality. I’m giving it 4 stars—nearly perfect, just slightly too boxy for my taste, but still a fantastic value for the price. Read more",

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fun Fact: The Word Sweater Comes From the Word Sweat",
        "body": "I love this sweater. Let me repeat it, since you may not have heard me. I love this sweater! It is from Amazon’s Original Collection and picked by Demi Lovato. It’s oversized, which is perfect for me because I live in the cold Midwest, and need to layer clothing. I wear a 1X and/or a 2X depending upon the fit and style. I ordered a burgundy 2X to be sure. I don’t care for clothing which binds me. Loose is perfect for me. It looks and feels heavy like wool, which I’m allergic to, but is made from 60% cotton. It’s soft, but not “gushy” soft like some polyester blends, which make me too hot because they don’t breathe. This sweater is in one word, substantial: Color, weight, weave, size, fit, fabric and color blends. The crewneck doesn’t choke me, but keeps me warm. The ribbed sleeves make it easier to pull up my sleeves when I wash my hands. (I hate the feeling of wet clothes on my skin.) There is nothing flashy about it, but it is still a lovely addition to my winter wardrobe. Read more",

        "body": "This sweater is hands down one of the comfiest, warmest things I've gotten in a long time. The fit is absolutely perfect. It's oversized but it's not so big that I feel like I'm swimming in it. I also like that it doesn't hang weird, especially around the shoulders and arms. The material is very soft, which was surprising to me since it does feel a bit heavier, so I thought for sure it would be made of some sort of wool or bulkier type material, but instead it feels almost silky in texture. As I mentioned, it is a bit on the heavier side as far as weight goes, but for me, that's perfect as I can wear it during the beginning of winter without also wearing a coat over it. This sweater feels and looks like one of those quintessential \"couple holding cups of hot cocoa by the fireplace while it's snowing outside\" sweaters, and I am not mad at it. Love this sweater SO MUCH and can't wait to throw it into my winter rotation for the next couple of months! Read more",
