She needed something with a bit of sparkle for a recital, and this fit the bill. It is a very flattering fit (we got the medium in the peacock color; my kiddo is 120 and 5'1), and I could see many body shapes wearing this style. She didn't have to put a cami underneath bc the material is thick enough not to show undergarments and also it is not too low cut. At a dinner we attended she wore this dress with shorts underneath so she could dance afterward w/o a worry. A great dress and comfortable enough that she will wear it more than once. Bonus.

        "body": "I dressed up as \"The Christmas Witch\" for our local Festival of Lights and Lighted Parade and the outfit was a huge success! Everyone loved it. Dress was absolutely perfect - I was even able to wear a bra even though it sits pretty far out on the shoulders. Dress is nice, velvet fabric and kept me pretty warm. Fit really well - I'm 5'3 and about 140 lbs and the medium was perfect. It does have some give and is very comfortable - and that's coming from a picky person. I also thought the long sleeves were excellent, as many times my shoulders and arms are cramped or won't fit in dresses made for people with very slim arms. I paired it with furry cuffs and leg warmers and a pair of lined tights, as well as a petticoat type thing to go underneath and add volume. Very much reminds me of something an ice skater would wear. Great dress! Read more",

Imagine my disappointment when I just can't get it to sit right... i'm 4'11\" and about 155 lbs and I ordered an XL despite them telling me a L would fit me. They never do, i always size up. I'm a 36DDD, so I'm used to things being a bit strange on me. Well, this was totally bizarre. I'm used to the top being tight and the waist being loose, but this was the opposite. The arms are too long and the top was so loose I had to wear a specific bra for it to stay put. The waist actually fit perfectly, just snug enough to convince me the Large would be too small. It was also too long for my liking, but I'm short so that's a non issue, I hem most of my stuff anyway. I planned to wear this to dinner on a trip I'm taking with a friend. We were doing a velvet look, me in blue and him in red. Now because it took so long to arrive, I can't even TRY the Large because it'll come the day after we leave. So there goes that plan. For the price, I'm extremely disappointed. I've bought cheaper things on Amazon that fit way better. This is just bizarre. Read more",
