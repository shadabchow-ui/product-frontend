It is very warm and heavy, perfect for fall and even winter days, mire like a coat than sweater. I have not washed it yet, and if I have to I will probably give it to dry-cleaners. The pattern looks beautiful and also photographs very well. It doesn’t seem like it will fuzz up, what makes the price of it totally worth it. Seems like it will last for a very long time. I’m 5’10 with a slim torso. The length of size M seems great. I live the collar. I also like the fact that I can roll up the bottom if the sweater under and make it look great with high waist jeans.

        "body": "The craftsmanship is amazing. The wool is very dense brioche stitch. It is so heavy that it could/should be worn like a jacket. The fit is quite over sized but that is a good thing because someone is more likely to wear long sleeves under it because it is 100 percent wool. Sometimes I wash my dry clean only wool clothes by hand at home but I am unwilling to take the chance with this one-I can tell that it would definitely shrink if wet. I was considering knitting this pattern myself but it was on sale and thought it would be worthwhile to wear and use as a reference, especially considering the time and cost of materials. If someone preferred a lighter sweater, hated wool, or worried about ruining this sweater, a knock off of this pattern might suffice. It’s somewhat deceiving —the way it’s worn in the movie. The sweater is such high quality and woolly that I would never think of wearing it with a T-shirt and PJ bottoms. Read more",

        "body": "I adore this sweater. I live in Michigan and it can get bitter cold. Today was a balmy 35 degrees and I used this sweater as a coat. Worked great. Also really enjoy the double zip feature. For reference, I’m 5’4, 170 and I got the XL. Fits perfect. I do have to say, I’m a little disappointed that the sweater is “pilling” under the arms after just 3 times wearing. Maybe that’s what lamb wool is supposed to do? I can live with it, seeing I will have this for decades. Don’t hesitate to buy this. This is a piece that can be passed on to kids and grands if you take good care of it. You’ll also get a lot of people smiling at you when you wear it, but that just my opinion, man! Read more",

        "body": "This is a sweater for a serious individual. It's truly the heaviest, most well-made item of clothing I own now. I can see how people have Pendleton sweaters for decades because they're built to last. I bought this because of the Lebowski connection, but surprisingly the two people who commented on it had no idea what that meant, they just admired the fact that it \"must be a Pendleton.\" I did notice one review stating that the fabric was itchy, but I didn't find that to be an issue for me. Overall, I feel like this was a great investment. Read more",

        "body": "Pendleton always makes beautiful items that are warm and high quality. My issue here is that the sweater was advertised as a retun: \"Condition: Used - Like New Minimal signs of wear, consistent with being tried on but not used. Item may not come in original packaging.\" Once received, the sweater has a large stain on the front pocket, substantial pilling under the arms, and there was hair on it. This was not a like new item but rather a well used item that was returned. Went to Amazon for help and unfortunately, no replacement was available for it. They offered an additional discount and I will try to take out the stain, but buyer beware. No information available for the seller either. Read more",
