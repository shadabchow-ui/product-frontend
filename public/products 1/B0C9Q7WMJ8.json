        "body": "I bought white. I am 5'2 and this is a perfect floor length for me. It comes to just above my ankles. The sleeves are pretty, but a little on the sheer side. I always wear a sweater over my dress anyway. I got a large size, and it fits perfectly. I like the top with the gathers, and the skirt is nicely lined. I wear a longer white slip underneath so I have coverage all the way to the bottom. I like the pockets too. They are nice and deep. I found them to be a little hard to find, but I know I will get used to where they are. The fabric is soft and comfortable. I like the style because it helps to camouflage my menopause middle - meaning the fabric isn't clingy, but loose and flowy. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Read more",

The fabric is lightweight but not sheer, and the smocked waist gives it a nice shape without feeling too tight. One thing to note is that this dress is very modest—it covers everything from neck to wrist to ankle, almost like a Mormon-style conservative dress. If you’re looking for something stylish yet fully covered, this is perfect! The pockets are a great bonus, and it works well for dressy or casual occasions. Overall, it’s a lovely, well-made dress, just make sure the modest style is what you’re looking for! Read more",

I'm not a huge fan of elasticized clothing, but this one worked well at the bust and was flattering to my figure. It looked more like a slightly elongated empire waist. The rest of the dress was a beautiful lace with a lining that was not sheer at all. It washed well on delicate cold, and I laid it flat to dry. It looks great, no corners cut that I can see. I wear a medium in most tops and dresses. Sometimes I fit a small. This dress fit like a glove, and I'm sure I could have fit a size large if I wanted it to feel a little bit more roomy. I wear booties with 2\" heals, and the dress was the perfect length. It did not drag on the floor. Though it would if I was barefoot. 127 lbs, 5'3, 34D Read more",

It is EVERYTHING that it looks like, even the clay rose color is accurate. If you are looking for a modest dress, and do not require a super loose bust area, this is IT! For my hijabi friends, the sleeves are *slightly* sheer, but based on the color you order, and your preference, you may not actually need to wear a long sleeve shirt under it. The neckline is slightly wider than a true crew neck, but easily would be covered by a scarf. IMO doesn't need a highneck undershirt, just a hijab. It is full length skirt, even on my slightly tall body. The sleeves go all the way down to my hands, and still have slack/poof. The bodice is comfortably stretchy due to the shirring; it is fitted, but not too tight on my bust. (If you wear larger than DD bra/Large shirt, the bodice may be tighter. It will still fit because it will stretch but if you want a looser bust area, size up.) This dress even has pockets, though they are not very deep. The bodice is completely opaque. The sleeves are slightly sheer, but the pattern and color obscure the view. The skirt is lined and flowy! 10/10 IMO, would order again and recommend to my modest girlies! Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
  "about_this_item": "Womens Maxi Dress Maxi Long Sleeve is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
