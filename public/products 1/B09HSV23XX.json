        "body": "I'm happy with this! It was on a good sale which is always a blessing! So, I got a couple of them to wear around the house. They're very comfortable but I think I also look 'presentable' hehe. It's so difficult to find all cotton clothing these days, so that's a real plus for me-- and that's what I specifically was looking for. I'm 5'4 133 lb and I actually ended up getting the large, after trying on the medium--which seemed a little too fitted for me. I'm not wearing it with the belt. It's easy to snip the belt off. I like the v-neck and I also like the side slits (I think they're about 10 inches). I saw some comments about the pockets. And yes I do think they are place a little high, but for me it works as I'm a bit short waisted. I do appreciate the OEKO-TEX certification that Amazon got on this. There is no chemical odor or anything from the black fabric dye. I hope this information is helpful to someone else. Read more",

        "body": "This is a surprisingly nice T-shirt dress and fits true to size. The green was more of a drab olive than the brighter green in the photos of the model. The cotton is very thick, not see through, hangs well, and very forgiving of figure flaws. The scoop neck is a nice shape and still modest for large busted women. The midi length and short sleeves are perfect length and hang well. The reason I sent it back is because the pockets are set so high they are sticking out at the waistline adding a lot of unflattering bulk on my 5’7 1/2” frame. Secondly, the belt was set way too high. Had the pockets not been an issue, I’d have removed the belt and used without the loops at my actual waistline. But the pockets were that much of an issue. If you’re the right height/fit for the pockets and belt, this is a great dress. Note to women: it’s really off-putting to try on a dress that reeks of BO the moment the package is unsealed. Please be courteous when trying clothing on. Read more",

I am 5'5 about 137 and Amazon recommended a medium but I went with a small because sometimes midi dresses are more maxi on me and I wanted to ensure a midi length. The small fits great! I do wish the pockets were down a little lower because they could slightly interfere with the belt. They put the top of the pockets right where the belt is. Very comfy and perfect for work.
