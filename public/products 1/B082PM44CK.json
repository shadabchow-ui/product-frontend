        "body": "I bought this dress specifically for a cruise formal night, and it ended up being absolutely perfect. The material is thick, super soft, and incredibly stretchy, so it hugs your curves in all the right ways without feeling tight or restrictive. It really does fit like a glove, but in a comfortable, flattering way. The V-neck and ruched detailing give it a beautiful shape, and the high waist adds a slimming effect that looks great in photos—especially cruise formal photos! I felt sexy, confident, and completely comfortable the entire night. Read more",

The dress feels like it has a double layer of thick material to suck everything in without shape wear, instead a really soft comfortable type of compression. I plan to still wear mine but in the pic I have no shape wear or bra on. It hugs curves in the perfect spot. Would be flattering on anyone. I pair my dress with a gold belt that looks just like a Versace belt for 10 bucks on Amazon and it looks amazing together. I’m 5’5 170lbs and got a large. Just buy the dress! Read more",

I am normally a size M so I ordered the M and it fit Perfectly! Hugged in all the right places and hid some less than flattering areas. The dress was very comfortable with soft, stretchy material but more importantly, my undergarments were unnoticeable. My only concern was the V-neck. It was a bit lower than I had anticipated so the bra I originally had in mind didn't work but, no worries, that is what boob tape is for. Overall, I loved the dress, felt very sexy in it and I have already recommended buying this dress to ladies I know. Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Bodycon Cocktail V Neck Ruched Long Sleeve is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Brown, Dark Grey, Rose, Black, Orange, Light Olive, Red, Navy, Wine Red, Khaki, Pink, White, Fluo Pink, Royal Blue.
