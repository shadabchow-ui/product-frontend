        "body": "I am so pleased with this skirt; its quality far exceeds my expectations for this price point. The fabric is wonderfully soft and appropriately thick--not flimsy or see-through. The cut and the fabric's softness cause the skirt to fall in graceful folds, at a perfect length, especially with boots. I'm 5'4\", 125 lbs, and the hem hits at a few inches below my knee. It's nicely finished, with a cute button detail near the pockets, those nice pockets themselves, and a nicely hidden zipper. The waist has elastic for ease and fit. The wool-blend fabric is just the right weight to flow prettily and keep me warm, without appearing bulky. I chose the soft grey and black plaid, and I really like the colors and their versatility. I'll be getting plenty of wear from this, and the classic silhouette will never go out of style. Read more",

        "body": "This skirt is comfortable and flattering. The zipper is easy to zip and unzip. Also the skirt has a bit of elastic in the back which helps give you a little room for movement or for tucking in a blouse. It seems very well made and has a bit of tummy control in the front which gives a flattering shape. I ordered this in my usual size. I feel if I would have sized up it may be a bit too big and not as flattering. It is lined and thick and will give you some added warmth in the cooler temperatures. I highly recommend this lovely skirt! Read more",

        "body": "This skirt is sooooo cute. It’s so soft and not at all itchy, it feels high quality. I only took a star off because one of the little flaps with the buttons on it near the pockets had a seam snapped so it doesn’t stay down but it’s nothing I can’t sew on myself. The skirt is a great thickness, but doesn’t feel like I’ll be sweating when I wear it. I love the elastic on the waist band and even though I’ve gained some weight recently, the large fits me perfectly. It’s not see through at all and even at 5’2” it’s not too long and doesn’t make me see too squat, I’m excited to wear it with booties to give me a little extra height. Read more",

        "body": "-This skirt is great! I wanted something to pull out year after year and this seems well made. Definitely for fall/winter as it is warm and heavy in material. Add thermal leggings and insulated shoes and you will be toasty outside on even really cold days. -The pockets are very deep and things don’t fall out; the silver buttons are for looks only and they may need some reinforcing. -Its waistband is wide and therefore doesn’t dig in. There is elastic to the back on the sides only. There is a hidden zipper in the back. It also has a slip liner so it isn’t itchy; the only thing to note about it in case your skin is very sensitive like mine is the liner isn’t on the waistband which has been fine as I tuck my shirts into this skirt. -It is long on me which I expected and wanted. Maybe an inch and a half above my ankles at most. -The drape and flow when moving are very comfortable and classy looking. I am wearing it a little high on my waist (a little on my ribs) because of postpartum tummy, but without that it would easily slide down to my natural waist all the way. (Side note on postpartum wearing, you may want to wait till your abs come back together a little as this skirt adds bulk and you may feel huge. 🙃 ) -I’m very petite, 5’1” and currently around 130lbs (100-110lbs without baby weight). Size medium fits perfectly; I wear size 8 jeans which is right in line with the size chart provided. My only dilemma is whether or not to get more in my current size or wait till I get the baby weight off and size down. 😂 -So far it washes well and it doesn’t wrinkle. I use permanent press cycle and part low heat and air drying. It has not shrunk. Read more",

        "body": "I wish I could give this 2.5 stars, because 2 is too low, but 3 is too high. This is a satisfying skirt. I have bought three of these in different patterns, because I was, and still am, satisfied with look and feel of them. The thickness of the wool is nice. The sizing is also nice; I have trouble with a lot of pants because my waist is typically too small, but the elastic waist on this skirt fits me well. Unfortunately, there are a few complaints I have that remain consistent across multiple purchases. First of all, I wish the inner lining went down a little farther. It covers about half the length of the skirt, which is ok, but leaves my lower legs brushing against the outer wool layer, and also means I am slightly colder when I wear these in the winter. This is a minor complaint. My major complaint is the sewing, which is shoddily done at the waist. There are parts where a machine hem was clearly attempted, but failed. This leads to trails of thread that I have to cut off and resew myself. Each skirt takes a few hours of work to fix properly and make sure I can safely wash it. The most recent one I bought (the brown checkerboard pattern) had such a big problem that I could see between the wool layers. I should not be able to see in between the wool layers. This, I believe, is the worst issue. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Wine, Plaid Orange New, Plaid Green, Dark Grey, Plaid Brown, Plaid Grid Coffee, Plaid Wine, Camel, Coffee, Plaid Orangecoffee, Pure Black, Plaid Purple, Pure Khaki, Plaid Green 01. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
