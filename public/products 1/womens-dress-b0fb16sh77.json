        "body": "I had seen this dress locally but not in my size so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It's great original-quality denim fabric, no stretch. Being busty but slim-armed, I always have to be careful about armhole gaping with sleeveless tops but this dress fits perfectly--the armholes fit me well with no bra peek. The buttonholes are pretty tight (as on the fly of the 501's) so they do take a bit of wrangling. The up side is they stay buttoned well. This dress looks cute with the bottom couple of buttons left open. I'm on the short side--5'3\" and it hits about 2 inches above the knee on me. This is really a great, comfortable, versatile Levi's dress with good fit and quality, which makes the Levi's price totally worth it. Read more",

I was looking for it to be looser fitting but to my surprise the tag said “SLIM FIT” I normally wear a 3x so I bought the 4x to be safe and it’s true to its tag label but the description under specification says “standard fit” So that why it has a 3 star, the shape and texture are true to the description.

        "body": "What a gorgeous piece. It is how I envisioned it and fits so well. It is a sturdy denim that has a thickness to it that you can wear layered during the cold season and still wear it in one piece during the hot season. I am petite and small chested (34A), so this dress fits just right for me. The chest is a bit roomier but doesn’t scrunch up like other dresses would with the shape that it provides. Previous reviewers said to size up if need more room for chest. It wouldn’t make sense to size up because the dress would be too roomy and big. Love the quality, love the look, all season wear. So versatile. A must piece and a closet staple. Read more",

I have a larger chest (36DD) and it was too snug if I wore a regular bra, so I actually went without - which I never feel comfortable doing, but this dress held everything in place! It was great. At first, it had a bit of a weird chemical smell to it, but that came out easily after the first wash - it also did not seem to fade at all after washing. It’s extremely good quality denim, has a little bit of a stretch but not too much. I wore this all summer, and I will continue to wear it in the fall and winter. Read more",
