        "body": "I bought this for a sock hop that I hosted for the retirement community I work at. I wasn’t sure what size to get so I ordered a large and extra large just in case. Pros- The large was a perfect fit, so it is true to size. Proportions were perfect. It had just enough stretch to be perfectly comfortable all day, but did not stretch out or get misshapen. It looked good even before I put my petticoat on. This dress stirred up so many happy memories for my residents! All of the ladies were telling me about their dresses that they used to wear, the parties they went to, the dancing and romancing! Cons- it was a little warm. I was followed all day by inappropriate old men. Wrinkles a bit, but not excessively. I can’t wear it every day and I really wish I could. Read more",

The fabric is not quite as nice as I would expect from something that's mostly cotton. What's worse, in my opion, is that the chest area has a polyester lining (so the I dont think the dress isn't really 95% cotton, as advertised). The fabric itself is reasonably solid and not at all see through, so I'd have rathered they leave off the polyester. The pockets are great, and easily replace a small purse. I fit a full size phone and wallet in one, and keys, swipe card reading glesses, and sunglasses in the other. The skirt is a nice midi length. The cap sleaves are cap sleeves. They are a bit restrictive, but really not too bad for normal daily movement. I got it on sale for $20, and it is a good value at that price. At its norma $40, whether it's a good value depends on how picky you are about fabric, and how you feel about a dress that really is only for October... Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.",
  "about_this_item": "Womens Dress Cocktail is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit.

  "long_description": "Womens Dress Cocktail is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Pinkflower, Pumpkin, Whitepinkrose, Black, White Lemon, Black White, Orange, Porcelain, Red Dot, Black Red Plaid, Red Plaid, Blackflower, Yellowwhiteflower, Leopard. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
