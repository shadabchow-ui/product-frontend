        "body": "This was one of the many white dresses I ordered trying to find the perfect dress for grad pics. I ultimately went with a different dress, but it wasn’t because I didn’t love this dress. It is such a flattering, comfortable, beautiful dress. The material is stretchy with a soft mesh over it and was really nice quality. Even in white it was not see through which was nice. My favorite part was the back which was still flattering even on my flat grad school behind. I ordered in both a medium and small and liked the fit of the small better. It’s a great value for the money, but because I was going to be wearing my graduation gown for the pics I went with something sleeveless. I do highly recommend and would consider reordering for an even or a night out. For reference I am a Victoria secret 34DD, and a size 27 or 3 in pants. Read more",
