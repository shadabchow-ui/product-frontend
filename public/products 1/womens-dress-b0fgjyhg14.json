This one isn’t really my favorite compared to the others, but to be honest, if I had received this one first and wasn’t comparing it to the others, I’d be thrilled! It is soft and the color and fit are exactly as described. It doesn’t hang as low as I expected though, and it isn’t quite as relaxed, so it looks more bulky on me than I expected. Still, it’s warm and when the snow hits, who cares about looking bulky? It’s well made, and very comfortable, like most items I’ve worn from Aelfric Eden. It is machine washable (but they say to use a laundry bag), but you’re not supposed to put it in the dryer. I wish we were that organized with laundry around here! I can guarantee it will accidentally make it into the dryer. I’ll try to remember to come back to report if it holds up ok when that happens.i expect it to be durable enough for that, but i worry about shape and shrinkage. Read more",

I then tried the size X, which was only slightly better, with minimal difference. I also tested a medium, but the sleeves were too short. The lantern sleeves are disproportionately large, and the fabric feels quite thick. The one detail I did appreciate is that the cable design appears on both the front and back, which is rare to find. At this point, I’m still undecided about whether to keep the X. Read more",
