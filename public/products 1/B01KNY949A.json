Pros Love the 3/4 sleeves Material - Great weight on the dress - not to heavy, not to light or flimsy Love the midi length The background color is nice The fit is comfortable - I normally wear a large, but wanted it roomy for my surgery Love the blind pockets Cons - and the reason for return: Pattern matching! As you can see, there was no attention paid to this when they seamed the dress to create the flowy feel. What could have been very cute, looks very GRANNY on. Read more",

It is a modest dress but I feel very pretty in it. I wore it with sandals today but it could be dressed up a little more with different shoes and jewelry choices could dress it up or down also. I am 5'2 and it falls well below the knee without touching my feet or feeling too long. The fabric thickness is substantial so that I am not worried about it being see-through. I am all about clothing that is both pretty and practical, that is forgiving on a woman of middle age she is not as small as she used to be, and that I don't have to think too much about when making decisions about what to wear. This dress is all of those things. Read more",

Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Army Green New, Brown, Deep Green, Dark Grey, Black, White Floral, Brown Floral, Beige, Misty Rose, Grey Dot Printed, Navy Floral 01, Royal Blue, Beige Floral 01, Mauve. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
