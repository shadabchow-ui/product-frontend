        "body": "I wore this dress to a wedding and received non-stop compliments all night! The dusty blue color is stunning, and the velvet is incredibly soft with zero shedding or bald spots. The quality is outstanding—thick, luxurious material with just the right amount of stretch. As someone who is very curvy, I appreciated how flattering and forgiving it was without ever feeling restrictive. It was genuinely comfortable to wear, walk, and dance in the entire night. I loved the adjustable skinny strap (which I think would be easy to tuck in if you prefer a true one-shoulder look) - it gave me total confidence with a strapless bra. The zipper-controlled side slit is so cool — you decide exactly how high it goes, and it stayed perfectly in place all night (no creeping up, even with lots of walking around/dancing). Length was spot-on for my 5'2\" frame in 2.5\" heels: long and elegant, hitting just below the ankle with my shoes fully visible and no risk of tripping. Keep in mind I have wide hips and a bigger butt, which tends to shorten dresses a bit, so it may run longer on someone with a straighter silhouette. I didn’t manage to get great full-length photos, but I hope this review helps! Read more",

        "body": "If you are in between sizes, size down. I’m generally a small but the XS fit perfectly while the S could do but was loose in the waist (5 ft and 112 lbs). The pink is nicer and more elegant in person while still being lively. The skirt is a thinner material but given it’s a black, glittery material it provides full coverage. The dress is stunning and form fitting with stretch so it flatters and hugs your curves. The skirt zipper is such a great addition - you can unzip it more if you want a sexier and more sultry look, or zip it more if you prefer. With 3 inch heels the length was fine - probably will hem it about an inch. As far as quality, it looks great. I have a similar, brand name dress and the quality of the brand name one is better as far as having a slip layer and thick material that looks very luxe while on. However, this dress looks great too relative to its price and the color scheme makes it stand out in a good way. This can be worn to a formal wedding, a gala, or any formal event and it looks great. So if putting it next to the brand name dress and touching the fabric, yes the brand name ones feels more luxe and classic. Once on, however, this looks great and high quality. Read more",

The picture is more royal blue. Its still worth every penny considering its a long formal gown. I was having fun with the slit up the front of the dress. You can make the slit short starting from below the knees or go it as high as your panty line! There are no pockets in the dress. The dress is true to size. I am a size 10 and large fit like a glove, hugging every curve of my body. I would not pass on this deal and I am thinking of getting one in red! Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Ruched One Shoulder Maxi Evening Formal is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan.
