        "body": "I cannot say enough great things about this dress. I would give it 15/10 stars if I could. It was sooo flattering. So comfy, the mesh is so soft and stretchy. Not see through at all. So comfortable, I could wear it to sleep if I wanted. The scrunching is so perfectly placed, can hide imperfections or a little extra skin/fat. The color is absolutely beautiful. I got so many compliments and felt beautiful. Wore it for an outside wedding in July and did not feel like I was suffocating from the dress, very airy and ventilated The length was perfect, could probably be a great length for different heights. The stretch was perfect, could possibly work for maternity dress, sizing accordingly. I could see a bump fitting fine, lots of stretch. The opening in the front was good length, didn’t feel like my undies would show if I sat down or opened legs too much. Comfortably danced in it all night. Did not ride up at all all night. The high neck was so classy. All in all, my favorite dress of the year. I’m 5’4, 135 lbs, 34 DD. Size medium Read more",

        "body": "I bought this as a backup to wear to an event because I have too many black dresses and wanted to wear another dress I bought that was green. Well I put this one on and said wow ok screw the green dress this one is amazing. The material is a polyester type so it really stretches and hugs curves super well. I’m 5’1” and 105 lbs and I got the small which was perfect for me. I think it’s true to size because it does stretch a lot. The material being a polyester/spandex type makes it look like it could look cheap on you when you wear it but all that doubt disappeared when I put it on because it looked really fantastic and you couldn’t even really notice the material when I wore it (at least the black color). The shape was really quite pretty too with the ruffles higher in the front. It looked really nice when walking and posing for pics. AND it was SOOO comfortable all night. I put it on and felt like I wouldn’t have to be adjusting it all night and I felt like I didn’t need to wear a bra and was just so comfy all night. If you’re considering this dress but worried of buying one off amazon, I would encourage you to try this one!! Read more",

The colors of both materials match each other perfectly and are just like pictured. It is a bit tighter than I was anticipating based off of the size chart. It is also a bit sheer but i did purchase a light color and like I said it is a bit tight. The bottom of it isn’t quite a “high low” but rather an asymmetrical cut, with it being long in the back, and on the front the dress comes up higher on my right leg than my left. I am a bust 38F, and it doesn’t stretch awkwardly across my chest at all, and it’s quite flattering on my tummy. If I’m able to I will attach pictures later but I do not have any pictures presently.
