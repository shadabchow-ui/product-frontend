Very comfortable and a good length so I didn’t feel like I had to make sure I was covered all the time. The material does have some stretch to it but fits true to size/oversize. I will say the material does snag on stuff so you have to be careful what you rub up against or get close too. The quality of the material is good though. Read more",
