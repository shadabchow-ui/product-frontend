        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect! But there’s been a change in material!!!",
        "body": "I got this to wear on Christmas. I ordered it on December 22n’d, it arrived on time. I got xtra large. I am 5’4” and 170lbs, but most of my weight is on my bum/thighs and arms. I have a narrow waist and small chest. The dress hit exactly at my knee. I haven’t washed it yet and I don’t know, but don’t anticipate it any shrinking. It fit with some additional room in the waist/chest area but was comfortable and fit perfect for a holiday, lots of room for all the food I ate and super comfortable for all the sitting I did, but I could have gotten a large. **NOTE** However, I have to say that it wasn’t what I was expecting, as I buy this dress in different patterns often. It has been one year since I bought one however and these are the noted changes… The material is very different and initially, out the bag I was VERY upset… but there’s a happy ending! So, I have tried to highlight the differences in the attached pictures. For the comparison the older dress from 2021 is Red/Navy, while the Green/Navy dress is the newest from 12/24 (the most recent dress prior to this one is from Winter 2023 and is the same as the red/navy). For starters the new one has a liner…YES, a glorious liner!! I have some small sensory issues, but with this dress… I could sleep in this dress! Don’t get me wrong, the red one is comfortable, but it is nothing compared to the new green/navy lined dress! While the old dress is obviously mostly cotton, evident by everything in the world wanting to stick to it. It does a far better job in catching all the lint than the dryer lint basket!! I now wash and dry that dress alone! Yet it gets worse, the red/navy, notorious for the stubborn wrinkles! The come out with ironing and you get a couple hours of sophistication.. But this new dress (hearts for pupils) The new dress ARRIVED in an amazon special delivery bag(sarcasm) it arrived in a BALL, but that darn thing slipped out and was ready to wear. Now that I think about it, I am pretty sure an iron would melt it, lol! But lets not get bogged down with silly details. What is important is that despite my initial hate and skepticism for the change in material…. after wearing it on Christmas I then decided to wear it on my drive home, 14 hours!!! And that trip was never more comfortable! Lastly, it comes with a sash, of which I didn’t wear around my waist, instead i used it for a headband, when they come with the sash I usually go the headband route, but you should know it was BIG, the sash was ready for anyone’s waist, for real.. Also note there are no sash loops on the dress, which I prefer. Finally, I returned to order more and figured I would leave a review. They’re true to size IMO, comfortable and versatile. I often wear these dresses with a pull over sweater/boat neck.. and you can’t see the top so it appears that I am wearing a skirt and top. Or you can wear a cardigan, or you can wear a white button down dress shirt (fitted), but of course it really needs nothing. Overall it is a very pretty and flattering cut and I love the new material. Not sure what is up with the tags, but I don’t care either. Ordering more. Read more",

        "body": "(Scroll to end for underskirt tips.) I have this same “vintage cocktail dress” in 4 different fabrics now. One is a Grace Karen sequin dress, but it’s the same pattern. This is just a perfect design for me. It holds in my tummy, and is just very flattering. It has multiple colors for lots sweater/accessory options, and the design is super comfortable! The color on this is so lovely and I happened to have the perfect bright coral 3/4 decorative sweater to match! Except for the formal sequin dress, the others I wear all the time as: 1) Casual dresses with a regular slip, to the store or just a low key dinner, 2) as a nicer dress for church or fancy restaurant and I wear a tiered cotton underskirt to add a little floof that gives the skirt more character, 3) for special occasions, I add a petticoat to really add some flounce and I love the feeling of wearing a petticoat. I do this for events… like a formal dance, to stand at my jewelry booth, a holiday, or the theater. Then you just accessorize accourdingly! *My favorite floofy underskirt is: BEAUTELICATE Women 100% Cotton Skirt 3 Tiered A-Line Retro Medieval Skirt Length/color: The 22” ivory is perfect for these, but black also great. This length is not seen, totally hidden. *My petticoats are 25-26” to hang a little lower than the skirt and I prefer darker or brighter colors to emphasize that I’m wearing a petticoat. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Sleeveless Cocktail is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress Sleeveless Cocktail is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: A-blush Pink, A-hot Pink, Black Painting, A-burgundy, A-deep Purple, B-green Plaid, A-teal Blue, B-gold Plaid, Porcelain, A-steel Blue, B-red Plaid, Blackwhitesplaid, Lemon White, Lemon Navy. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
