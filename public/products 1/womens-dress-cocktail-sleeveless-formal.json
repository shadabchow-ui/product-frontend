        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Cute and flattering dress!",
        "body": "This is such a great dress! I wore it for a wedding and got a ton of compliments! The color is beautiful. I am usually between a Medium and Large for tops and dresses so I bought both sizes and went with the Medium. I am 5’4” 160lbs for reference! I am 8 months post partum and this was really comfortable and flattering considering I have some extra weight in my midsection. I felt super confident in this. The large fit nice too but I didn’t want a looser fit, I wanted something a little more curvy. So if you want looser fit, I’d order the large. As far as quality goes. I don’t think it will hold up for many washes. I will definitely be hand washing this but there are some loose strings that I think may be an issue at some point, but that seems to be common with this kind of silky material. For the price, I’m pleased with it! Read more",

It also had a dot on it, small enough not to see from afar if you aren’t looking but it was there.
