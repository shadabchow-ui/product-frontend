        "body": "About 7 years ago I bought this sweater from a local retailer in a pretty dark cream color (not available here). It’s such a cozy, classy, dress up or down essential in my wardrobe that I searched for it online. The sweater that I ordered (dark blue) is exactly the same, just as pretty and elegant, with the same quality wool yarn. It’s definitely snugger than the one I’ve been wearing for years and I imagine it will loosen up over time. If you’re a lover of Irish wool sweaters I highly recommend this. You can’t go wrong. I’ve worn it hiking, to business meetings and over a dress on a night out. If you want one with room to layer you may want to order a size up. If you want one that fits snugly over a dress or fitted outfit, order your size. I'm 5’4 and 115 lbs and the small fits to a T. Before ordering this I ordered another one from this company with a scrunched waist that hit me in the wrong place and looked bulky. This one is simpler and more flattering. Read more",

        "body": "This is the 2nd sweater that I have purchased from Aran Crafts. I purchased the Soft Cable Knit Side Zip Coat, in the wine color, last year. I loved the sweater so much, that I purchased another one last week, in the dark green. I should have bought one earlier, as I wanted to the charcoal color, but none were available in my size. I am 5'4 and 1/4 and generally where an XS top, sometimes a S. The XS fit me just fine. I even have room to put a turtleneck underneath, but the sweater is so warm, that even in NY, it was not necessary. I generally run cold, l and find this sweater to be perfect for the cold NY winters. The sweater is beautiful and very high quality and one can clearly see that, when they take the sweater out. Gorgeous pattern/stitching and I just love the stylish zipper, not plain at all. I will note that while cute, the zipper can be a bit tricky to zip, so just zip carefully- you will be fine! I also cannot stand an itchy sweater and so far it's been great! I would highly recommend this brand and this sweater to anyone looking to purchase a warm, stylish, top-notch sweater. I found another brand to be more expensive and the quality of their sweater was ok, but not top-notch like this. Read more",

        "body": "Due to reviews saying to size down, I ordered a small instead of a medium, and now have to return it because it's too small in the chest for me (I'm a 36D)...so I would order your regular size unless you have a small bust line. The quality of the garment itself is outstanding and I can't remember the last time I've been this impressed with a piece of clothing. The wool is thick and very warm, but not itchy at all. I did find the sweater to be a bit heavy on my shoulders since it's a long, thick wool coat...I may order the shorter version of this to reduce the weight of it. Of course wool like this is best spot cleaned only (it'll shrink badly if you wash it), but I find as along as I wear a shirt under it that's not deal breaker for me. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.",

This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs.
