        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fits wonderfully for busty girls!",
        "body": "Hey girls, the reviews are correct! This is an amazing dress! It fits so well, and I have a curvy body that isn't easy to fit. Ice sized up. I am 5'10\" tall, 150 pounds, and I wear a 36 DD bra. I usually wear a medium or a large in dresses, so I ordered the XL. It fits perfectly, I am so thrilled! I will be wearing this at a fancy concert. I ordered the sparkly royal blue and it is wonderful! The armholes cover my bra, and the skirt length is to my knees. Note… For Utah girls, it is not midcalf length. The matching tie can be worn around your waist in a side not or even a bow in the back. My daughter said you could even use it in your hair if you'd like since the dress has an empire waist line. This dress also has princess seams on the front and the back that rise up from the waist! This is very flattering for us large busty girls. I will be wearing slip shorts underneath since the fabric is only one layer on the skirt and will show panty lines. You could even purchase a short petticoat to really do the swing/cocktail look. The neckline on this dress for me is a nice rounded neck, not too low if you are dancing and don't want to fall out of the front of your dress! If you have a beautiful necklace pendant, that looks nice against the color you choose for the dress, wear it! I love the cap sleeves too, it should keep you cool if you are dancing. And for those of you who have definition in your arm muscles, you can show them off with this dress! The description of this dress says it has sequins, and if you are thinking those little round plastic notions that are reflective and have to be sewn on with thread, that is incorrect. For those of you who want the sparkly version of this dress, it is a beautiful thread that is used with sparkles in it so it is part of the fabric. you don't have to worry about any plastic sequins falling off. A much more modern version of sparkle. I am impressed with all of the color choices of this dress. The white version could be worn as a wedding dress, and so many pinks for those who love pink! If you are a mother of the bride, please know that this is not a long dress. It is definitely knee length unless you are very short, petite, and choose one of the little bitty sizes. After my concert, I will be coming back for another color for myself and one for my 19-year-old daughter who will be having a birthday soon! Read more",

        "body": "Starting out the dress is really cute. Im on the heavier side so it was a little tight but stretched enoughto get into it. THats on me for not ordering a size up. My only complaint is that I wish the waist sash was bigger so I could habe worn it the way the photo presents. On larger bodies it doesnt leave a lot to make a bow with so I ended up having to wear it without it. Also note thay the back zipper is difficult to do on your own so you may need a friend or family member to zip you in Over all very cute dress and got lots of compliments at the wedding I attended.

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Evening Formal Cocktail is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress Evening Formal Cocktail is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Glitter_black, Glitter_burgundy, Glitter_fuschia, Black Blue White Flower, Black Yellow Flower, Royalblue, Black White Flower, Rose, Blush Flower, Black, Champagne, Glitter_green, Darkgreen, Lavender. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
