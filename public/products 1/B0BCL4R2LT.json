        "body": "This dress is really lovely overall! The chiffon fabric is light and breathable, and the peasant sleeves and flowy shape give it such a soft, feminine look. I especially appreciated that it’s lined, so I didn’t have to worry about it being see-through. I wore it with heels to a recent work event and got several compliments! It felt polished yet comfortable, and I love that it can easily be dressed down with sandals for a more casual look. The fit was true to size, and the length was just right on me—not too short, even with heels. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the fabric wrinkles a little easily and could benefit from a quick steam or iron before wearing. But overall, it’s a great value and I’d definitely consider buying another color! Read more",

        "body": "This review will be similar to another review I read here, because it was completely on point. Pros: I was pleasantly surprised how well this fit and how cute it was. I attended a wedding and received many compliments on the dress. I like how the sleeves cover my arms, but are sheer, so it's cool enough for spring/ fall. The cut was perfect to cover my chubby mom tummy, but still very classy and flattering. Material is very light and flowy. I feel very comfortable in this. Cons: The dress is pretty short. I'm only 5'4\" (170lb). I got the size Large, and you can see it's still pretty short on me. Wearing this outside, the wind caught the fabric a few times and I def had several \"Marilyn Monroe\" moments... I'm sure I revealed more than anyone wanted to see that night. The snap on the cleavage area worked for me (I'm a 38C), but it was pretty cheap... felt if I moved the wrong way that it could bust open at any moment and also reveal more than I'd like. So maybe a safety pin would be more secure. Overall, I tried on like 30 dresses from Amazon... this was the clear winner, and I'd definitely wear this again! (Maybe on a non- windy day to an indoor event lol) Ps... don't mind the dusty mirror, but wanted to show how this dress looked. Read more",

While the elastic at the waist sits a little higher than depicted on the model, it’s still very comfortable to wear. A quick steam refresh would be wonderful, as it arrived vacuum-packed, but the fabric itself is incredibly soft and feels wonderful against the skin. I can easily dress this up with a stylish jacket for a more formal occasion, or keep it casual – it's a versatile and wonderful purchase, and I highly recommend it! Read more",

        "body": "I absolutely adore this dress! The fit is incredibly flattering, the fabric drapes beautifully, and it looks much more expensive than it is. I immediately felt comfortable and confident wearing it. My only minor critique is with the decorative snap on the front. While I appreciate that it's there to help prevent cleavage (especially for those with a larger bust), the snap itself is very shiny and stood out in an obnoxious way. I was able to easily remove it, and the dress is perfect now. If the snap were black or blended into the fabric better, it would be a non-issue. Overall, this is a beautiful piece I highly recommend—just be prepared to potentially remove or replace the front snap! Read more",
