        "body": "Everything about this sweater dress I love. The delivery, which I got next day delivery . The price, because the quality is great . The fit is as expected and the color is as pictured I'm 5' 0 1/2\" and I'm 180lbs and I ordered the X-Large, but I could've gotten a Large and been ok, but I figured and X-Large would be better , because I'm bottom heavy, with hips, thighs and big butt lol I saw this same dress on fashion Nova site for about the same price BUT I would've paid more to have it delivered AND the wait would've been longer AND if it didn't fit and I'd have to return, I wouldn't get a refund, but just a store credit, SO ordering from AMAZON was the better choice The quality is great. There are no loose threads and the dress is thick enough to wear late fall and winter time on any occasion . The color is light pink and looks very nice and the material is soft, NOT ITCHY, and the material is NOT cheap looking Buy this dress, you will not be sorry. It's worth the buy Read more",

        "body": "I have purchased a lot of Amazon dresses and this one is by far the nicest looking. I was sorta shocked by the quality, and fully expected to return it! If you're like me and read a million reviews to make your purchase I'll sum it up to make it easy, because I read so many for this one. - Yes, it runs a *touch* big. If you're between sizes I wouldn't recommend going up because you'll be swimming in the top. It's suuuuuper forgiving material. Stretchy, soft, thicker. (Warm!) - It's MADE for curvy women like myself, but I feel like it would look good on a lot of shapes with how soft and stretchy it is. - I actually love the connecting piece of fabric on back. I am always falling out of wrap tops (this is pseudo-wrap I'd say) but this helps keep things from falling out while still offering a very flattering neckline. I am 5'5\", 150-155 lbs, 36D, 29\" waist, 42\" hips. Got a medium, after debating a large for a long while. Was worried about the hips but honestly it's just so forgiving. It's ever so slightly tighter than I want it to be on bottom, but I wouldn't even call it an issue with how good it looks on my booty ;) Just throw on some shapewear. Hits mid-thigh, sleeves great length. Batwing arms are really pretty. Had I gotten the large the top would have been too big. Medium on my 36D chest is actually perfect. (Not too tight, not too loose.) I'll update with a photo when I'm able! Heck if I'm taking that photo with the state I'm in today though. TL;DR - GET THE DANG DRESS IT'S GORG. AND STICK WITH TTS OR SIZE DOWN. OKAY BYE. (And before I go, this shapewear is PERFECT paired with this dress: SEXYWG Womens Shapewear Tummy Control Panties Thigh Slimmer Butt Lifter Power Shorts. Just trust me. I feel like the shapewear queen these days #thankscovid) Read more",

        "body": "I adore this dress!! I bought it for our New Years Dinner. The fabric is perfect and it’s not to thick so I wasn’t overly warm. It wasn’t thin at all. It fits and drapes comfortably. No pulling and tugging at it all night. Sexy but still classy! It did have that ruffling at the ends of the sleeves that some of the other reviews mentioned but that wasn’t a deal breaker for me. My watch and bracelets kind of took the attention away from it. I love that the belt is on the wider side! I felt like it helped to accentuate my waist better. I bought a large for more of a night out vibe. I really wanted to show my curves and it did just that! I would definitely get an XL for the office so it fits a bit looser on the bottom. I felt super pretty in it so I’ll probably be buying a couple different colors! Definitely pleased! Go ahead and get it, girl! Read more",

        "body": "I am a curvy girl (hour glass figure-smaller waist/wider hips) normally wear a size 12 and medium to large top. I ordered a large In the maroon and it fits very well. When I first took it out of the package I thought “No way this is going to fit me!” However, it is stretchy, has some give, and really hugs my curves nicely. Thick and forgiving material but it doesn’t hide everything, if you don’t want it hugging your body, order up although I think an Xl would be too big in the arms and chest for me.. Super comfortable. Hits right above my knees because I am 5’3. I like it better without the tie Around the waist but kept the piece on the back so it is not off the shoulder. I tried it on and my husband was like “Oh, wear that Friday night, that looks good”. So I definitely recommend purchasing it! Read more",

        "body": "So I purchased this dress last minute 2 days before a Christmas party. I was weary of the stretch/sizing component in many of the reviews I'd read but purchased anyway hoping for the best. While some had said to size down I think those reviews were coming from petite women. I'm not quite plus sized but ordered my regular clothes size in an XL and it fit just right. The sweater material has a good amount of stretch but obviously not enough as I had to remove the back strap to wear the dress off the shoulder as pictured (the strap actually ripped before removal) and under my arm where the bodice attaches to the bottom skirt half or the dress ripped as well (luckily I had on dark undergarments that made the rip unnoticeable) All in all it is a really cute dress that could be made better.
