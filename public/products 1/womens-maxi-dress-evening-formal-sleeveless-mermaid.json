        "body": "Let me begin by saying that ANY dress (especially occasion dresses) will look a bit different in-person versus online because the majority of these models are around a size 2, so the images we see when purchasing the items will not translate the same on larger, more voluptuous body types. The dress may be gorgeous, but that doesn't mean it will flatter everyone. Having said that, let me get into this particular dress review... This dress is indeed gorgeous and I do feel that the style complements me! My measurements are 36-31-41 and I''m 5'9'' tall, and the size L fit nicely. For those measurements, I wouldn't go any smaller, but one size up would probably work okay too if you want a slightly roomier fit. It stretched just enough that I could pull it over my hips and sit comfortably in it. The off-white is very close to white, although it isn't stark and has a bit of a warmer tint to it. My biggest issue is that the draping on the chest didn't really hang the way I was hoping, even after moving it around several different ways. I'm wider in the shoulder area and am wondering if that's why, but even so, it doesn't have the \"cowl-neck\" look I wanted, so I opted to send it back. Overall I do like the dress style and fit, but since I can get a similar dress elsewhere I'd rather do so instead of settling for this one. Read more",

        "body": "The media could not be loaded. I bought the MUXXN Women’s 30s Brief Elegant Mermaid Sleeveless Gown for a formal event, and it exceeded every expectation. The cut is absolutely beautiful—very figure-flattering without being restrictive, and the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to move comfortably while still looking structured. The mermaid silhouette gives it such a classy, Old Hollywood vibe. I received so many compliments and felt confident all night. The quality is impressive for the price—the stitching is neat, the material feels durable, and it looks much more expensive than it is. Sizing was true to size for me (I went with my usual dress size). If you’re between sizes or prefer a little extra room, I’d suggest sizing up since the fit is tailored. Overall, this is one of those versatile gowns you could wear to a wedding, gala, or evening dinner and always look elegant. I’ll definitely be ordering it in another color! Read more",

I’m 5’5 and 135 lbs. I’m on the slim side, but any extra weight goes straight to my belly. Dress is very form fitting, but for me having my weight gain in the midsection, I’m hoping sizing up to a large that will give more looseness to where my belly button isn’t showing straight through and I do t look 3 months pregnant 🥴. One more try and if the results are the same then I’m done with this dress. It’s a beautiful dress but I’d be careful to say getting it last minute for an occasion and counting on it , it might be a big let down Read more",
