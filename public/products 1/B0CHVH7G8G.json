        "body": "I was shopping last minute for a dress to wear to my cousins wedding. I found this and was happy with the reviews- fingers crossed. It arrived (I bought a small and medium) and I immediately fell in love! Both fit great, but I went with the medium just because it fell a little more nicely. I have never felt so beautiful in a dress. It is soft and super stretchy and warm but doesn't make you roast. It's perfect for church, a winter wedding, or just date night. It's my new favorite and I'd like to find an excuse to wear it- and I typically don’t care much for dresses. I wear it with fleece lined leggings and I feel so cozy and comfortable, yet elegant, all day. I’m 5'9, 140lbs, it hugged me and made me feel like a princess. It comes mid to low shin. It twirls and it's loose yet fitted. It doesn't squeeze at all. Also if I eat way too much and press out my stomach, I found it'll make a wonderful maternity dress some day ha! If you’re wondering whether or not to, the answer is yes. I hope you love it as much as I do! I'd like to buy another in a different color (I have the green, gorgeous for any occasion!)
