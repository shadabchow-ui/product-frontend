        "body": "This dress was so comfortable and so flattering! The two side slits weren't revealing but instead provided a really pretty drape and flow to the dress. The fit was perfect, it hugs your curves but is flattering in the tummy area. I am 5ft 6in and weight 145 lbs and got the medium and the fit and length were perfect. Definitely recommend! I wore it for a wedding and it was perfect. The material is nice and thick as well, it isn't flimsy at all. Really a great dress for the money spent and the quickness of it arriving! Read more",

        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Green color is misleading but the royal blue is STUNNING",
        "body": "I'm 5'7, 175 lbs and my bust size is around 40\". I ordered an XL and it fit beautifully. The dress style is beautiful and it fit but the color wasn't accurate. I ordered a green dress expecting it to be a rich green color like pictured but it is more of a dull, dark turquoise color. Thats why I gave this only 4 stars. When looking through reviews, one made in May of 2024 has a picture and the green dress is the color like the photo, a vibrant rich green. In the last few days after receiving the dress, the photos provided on other reviews show the dress color is the dark turquoise. So I'm not sure why the color changed but I wish it was accurately shown on the model photo. I was disappointed with the color so I decided to return and choose the royal blue instead. I absolutely LOVED the royal blue dress. The fabric is very nice, it's 95% polyester and 5% spandex. But I do like that it's heavy and it seems to be a good quality dress meaning it's not cheaply made. I also added a gold concho belt to the look and I felt like it added a great touch! I highly recommend the royal blue dress. I hope my review helps others with deciding ton the green dress by making you aware of the color difference. Read more",
