        "body": "I ordered the Navy in size Small (I’m 5’9”, 125 lbs, 27” waist, 34” bust, 37” hips). The color is gorgeous—rich and elegant—and the fabric feels soft, cozy, and non-itchy. It’s a perfect weight for fall and winter, and the pleated skirt drapes beautifully. The challenge is the waist seam placement. On me, with a longer torso, the waist hits much higher than my natural waist—closer to under the bust. It throws off the proportions and makes the silhouette less flattering. I don’t think the dress is poorly made; it’s just not cut for long-torso frames. For average or shorter torsos, I imagine the fit would be much more flattering. Pros: Gorgeous navy color Soft, warm wool blend fabric Elegant pleated skirt and mock neck design Machine washable Cons: Waist seam sits high, not ideal for long torsos Overall the Sweater Dress is beautiful and perfect for fall and winter months. Just wish it had a longer torso. Read more",

        "body": "I have many, many items made by Arach & Cloz, and they never disappoint. This dress is no exception. It's soft, comfortable, and well made. I have a very long torso, so the fit is just a bit off for me - the waistline sits a little higher than I would like, however, it's not a deal breaker. The color is really lovely - it's less of an olive green and more of a forest green, but I actually prefer this. It's made a really lovely dress to wear to formal holiday dinners, and it looks great with tights and boots or heels. I do wish that the neckline was lower, or even a v-neck. The high neck, I feel, make my chest look bigger, and I don't need help with that at all. :) Other than that, it's a really nice dress. Read more",

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars It checks all the boxes of what you need in a wool blend dress!",
        "body": "If you’re someone who loves wearing dresses year-round but can’t stand freezing your way through winter, this wool-blend sweater dress from Arach&Cloz might honestly be the answer. It has quickly become my favorite winter dress—and here’s why. 🍁 The Color & Style Are Perfect for Cold Weather The rust shade is a true burnt orange, warm and rich in a way that feels made for fall and winter. The pleats start at just the right place to flatter the waist without adding bulk, and the length hits just under the calves—long enough to keep you cozy, but not so long that it feels dated. It strikes that perfect balance between classic and modern. 🧵 A Sweater Dress Without the Bulk This is genuinely a true sweater dress, but it’s been done so well. The wool blend isn’t scratchy (I was surprised!) and the dress doesn’t trap heat like many winter knits do. Instead, it feels soft, comfortable, and breathable—warm enough for cold days, without that heavy, overheated feeling. And the matching fabric belt adds shape without being fussy. 💍 Easy to Accessorize The neckline is a smart design choice: warm enough for winter but still flattering with most necklaces. Dress it up with jewelry, or keep it simple—the dress works either way. 👠 From Workday to Dinner—Effortlessly One of my favorite things about this dress is its versatility. I can wear it to work during the day, then head straight to dinner with friends without feeling underdressed or wishing I had time to go home and change. It’s polished, comfortable, and moves well with your body. ✈️ A Great Travel Piece The fabric makes this a surprisingly good travel dress—easy to pack, looks good right out of the suitcase, and pairs well with so many pieces. You can dress it up with boots and jewelry or throw on sneakers and a denim jacket for a casual look. Most sweater dresses can’t do that without looking bulky or shapeless—this one can. 📏 Fit & Sizing The fabric is forgiving, and I sized up out of caution since sweater dresses often cling too much. But honestly, I don’t think I needed to. Even a size up, it hangs beautifully and has that effortless “flow” you want in a winter dress. The fit is flattering, comfortable, and zero-maintenance—I’m never adjusting or tugging on it throughout the day. 👟 How I Style It My favorite combo: low-rise tennis shoes, a jean jacket, loop earrings, a simple necklace, and a chunky bracelet. It’s stylish without trying too hard—and so comfortable that I can focus on my day, not my dress. ✨ Final Thoughts Arach&Cloz really nailed it with this piece. It’s warm, flattering, versatile, and genuinely comfortable. If you want a winter dress that brings both style and comfort to your wardrobe, this one deserves a spot on your must-have list.
