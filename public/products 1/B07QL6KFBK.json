        "body": "This is a great little dress for a casual day. I planned on wearing it as part of an elf costume for Ren Fen and was going to use a PU leather corset, elf ears and tall boots to complete the look. The price is great, had tons of good reviews so I ordered it. I mean, it's a super cute dress on it's own and I would totally wear this to go out for lunch with friends or to any casual event, not just Ren Fen. Based on the Amazon suggested size for me I ordered a large (I'm in between a C cup and a D cup in bra size). It arrived quickly (my PU leather corset did not, sadly) and looked perfect. Well made, tight seems, great length. I ended up wearing it without my corset but the only thing that I had an issue with was the chest size. It was, still is a bit tight the chest. Tight enough that it's obvious that it does not fit and so for that reason it's been put in the costume bin and not a dress I would wear throughout the year. The arms fit great, the length was perfect - just above the knee - not too short, not too long. I still like the dress and end up wearing it with a super tight sports bra and an infinity scarf to hide the tight chest. I suggest ordering a size up if you have above average size breasts (I'm in between a C and D cup bra size). Read more",

The material feels cheap and rough to my hands. Although it's a chiffon-like material, it's not sheer. And it is not lined. So we have a dress that's unrelenting brown and white polka dots. The color was fine but I wanted it to be sheer with the liner. It fit ok in the arms and length but the chest was a bit tight. I returned it because it just wasn't right for me. Read more",

The quality of the dress was much better and thicker than I expected too! I’m 5’7” and the length was perfect too.

        "body": "I ordered based on the size chart and went with a medium. I could get it on, but I knew once I got it over my chest and shoulders it wasn't going to work. I think broad wide shoulders were more of an issue than my chest size. The even bigger challenge once it was on, was getting it off. Be warned- there is zero stretch to this fabric. I give it credit- it didn't rip even though I was pulling extremely hard in an attempt to rip it, because it wasn't going to come off any other way, due to no stretch and no zipper. I was by myself, and had the fleeting thought of going to my next door neighbor's house to have her pull it off of me. If I wasn't in a hurry to get out of the house I probably would have. And I don't even LIKE my next door neighbor. That's how desperate I was. I ended up having to literally cut it off of me. You think it's hard to take of a sports bra when you're sweaty? At least that has stretch, and if you're lucky you can pull it down your body rather than over your head. If you're within an inch of the measurements of the size chart, please size up. Otherwise, you'll end up wondering who you wronged in life to be trapped in such a cute top which you cannot escape without destroying it. Honestly it is super cute. I wish it didn't try to suffocate me. Two stars for cuteness. Negative 2304 stars for intent to kill. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress V Neck Long Sleeve is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.",
