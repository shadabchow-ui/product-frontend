        "body": "I recently tried this ribbed-knit mini dress and overall I’m really happy with it. The fabric is stretchy yet substantial, so it hugs the body nicely and gives that “tummy control / sculpted” silhouette, which I like. It’s not see-through, even in lighter colors — nice bonus for a tight-fitting bodycon. I found it versatile: perfect for a night out if paired with heels, but also works with sneakers or boots for more casual wear. On the flip side — because it’s quite snug and compressive, it can feel tight or restrictive if you’re between sizes or not used to “bodycon” fits. Also, the mini length might feel a bit short depending on your height or how you move. All in all — a flattering, confident-feeling piece if you’re looking for a sleek club / night-out dress, but size carefully and be aware of the snug fit if comfort / mobility is a priority.

The button-down detail on the top adds a cute and feminine touch, and the long sleeves balance the fitted silhouette perfectly. The length hits at just the right spot — modest but still stylish — and the overall fit gives a nice hourglass shape. It’s one of those pieces that you can dress up with boots and accessories or keep casual with slides, like in the photo. Simple, versatile, and effortlessly flattering. Definitely a great everyday dress. Read more",

I’m 5’8 roughly 200 pounds, but I am cosmetically enhanced. My measurements are 36” bust, 22” waist, 52” hips/butt.
