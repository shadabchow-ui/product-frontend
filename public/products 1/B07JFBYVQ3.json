Can't think of the last time a shift dress looked good on me - this has a good mix of A line and Shift style to be modern and cute for people with wider hips. Fabric was pretty good (not great, but good) quality. Very wearable for work and other events. Bought it for a funeral, might not wear it but still might keep it!

I purchased the Medium and it fits a little snugly. Its kinda tight around my arm pit and the neck is a little snug, but I was still comfy wearing it all day. It was so nice with my flannel over it. I am going to order a large in a different color just to compare sizes. But I'll probably keep both no matter what since my weight varies a bit. I wear dresses everyday and I want to add like 5 of this dress to my wardrobe! Oh and the fabric is nice - its got a good weight to it and doesn't show through every line and lump! Read more",

The top part of the dress - chest, neck, bust fit perfectly for a size medium but the bottom skirt part is seriously like a XXL. Its a strange dress and I'm not sure I'm going to keep it. If I returned for a small it would be super tight in the bust. I figured this would be a more form fitting dress but its a tshirt dress that flares like a 1950's poodle skirt.
