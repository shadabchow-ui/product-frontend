I know everyone sees white and thinks oh no it’s gonna be see through, this one is not! Yes if you guys wear black undergarments it’s gonna show but I wore nude and it was all white, no skin/nude color coming through. I did wear this for my halloween costume last year with my bf (he was Wall-e, I was Eve) and it was so comfortable, so cute and great value. The fit was amazing and made me feel so comfortable and confident! I’ve also never worn a square neck line and after wearing this i’ve realized I love that style!

Very flattering! It's soft and not sheer. I do recommend wearing a strapless bra or the soft nipple covers, though. The straps on the bra will be very noticeable in the shoulder area of the dress. Also, wear a pair of underwear that won't leave any noticeable lines in the dress. Probably like a thong or a nice shape-wear. It stretches out to just the right amount you need it to without over-stretching. I paired the dress with a pair of my favorite boot heels and tights, and it was absolutely BANGIN'! Wearing it this weekend for date night to surprise my fiancé. The man's jaw is going to drop! Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",
