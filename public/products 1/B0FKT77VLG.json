I ordered a size up since rouching is typically more forgiving when it's not stretched to oblivion, and I am sometimes sensitive to turtleneck styles. I wear womens 8-10, 36ddd. I ordered this in xL. The mesh on this dress is of the itchiest I've ever encountered. The sleeves were long but ridiculously tight..I have muscular arms, but have zero problems fitting sleeves in an xL, anything, until this dress arrived.. The sweetheart style neckline is lovely, however my large chest felt suffocated, and wearing it in a manner that the neckline didn't look misplaced, tugged at the more delicate mesh mockNeck rendering a sloppy look..this was both uncomfortable and unsightly on my body. The length was fabulous..I am 5'7\", and this falls just below the largest portion of my calves..so flattering..length can somewhat be adjusted if you order this in *your size according to *the sizeChart..you can scrunch the fabric more along the bodice. No slit, which I also loved. Hard pass for me though, due to issues regarding the mesh, misplaced neckline and mockneck on my particular bod. However, I am sure it'll look great on the bodies it is made for! Read more",
