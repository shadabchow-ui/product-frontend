        "body": "The media could not be loaded. I wanted to like this, but the rouching in the front is just not flattering. The dress size is large, I can go between medium and large but usually choose large because of my chest. I don't have much of a tummy but the rouching at the stomach and hip made it look like I have much more than I do. The rest of the dress I liked, I picked it because I liked the frilly shoulder bits, which are well done, I still like them. Other than the stomach my other complaint is that I'm not a fan of the white mesh at the cleavage, black mesh would be more cohesive, but that isn't anything a few moments with a sharpie couldn't fix in a pinch. The tailoring of the dress is good, seams match up evenly and the fabric is good thick quality. Zipper pulled smoothly and no issues pulling it past the waist seam like I have had in other dresses. The black is true black. Read more",

        "body": "Lovely dress! It's VERY tight in the chest, I don't wear bras so that might help with the squishing but my poor girls were flattened, and I'm maybe a b-c cup. The \"invisible\" modestly panel is a bit too white for me, I might end up trimming it out. I had to double check that this wasn't a maternity dress as there is a LOT of ruched fabric around the belly, but I appreciate that it's very flattering, hugs my curves perfectly, just hugs the girls into near oblivion. I personally think it looks better off the shoulder, the shoulder bows are a bit bigger than I'd personally normally go for, but they work, esp off the shoulder. The side slit is perfect, and with a cute stretchy belt this dress is perfect for casual dates or fancier occasions. It seems very well made, fabric is very thick and it's fairly heavy as it's double lined. Would make a great fall/ winter dress! All in all I'm very happy with it, will just need to figure out how to get the girls to breathe! I'd say it's a great value for the quality Read more",
