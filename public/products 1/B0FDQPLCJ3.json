        "body": "First dress I’ve bought that fit perfectly and met my expectations. Only flaw is a synthetic fabric smell that even after washing I can still smell a hint of but depending on what you use in your laundry (scent boosters) it could fix that. The material is thick and stretchy, almost like a swimwear fabric but not quite it’s hard for me to describe. The sleeves are my favorite part honestly. When I’ve bought other dresses the cuffing on the arms would irritate my skin or feel like my arm flab is getting cut off OR like the arm sleeve is too loose/ gaping and never seemed flattering for my arms so this is exactly what I wanted and is much much more flattering. I love this dress, I can envision several ways to style it, I bought it for a salsa class and it goes great with my heels but I can also imagine tights and a thigh high boot and a jacket for a winter look. I have an apron belly and I’m 100% comfortable and confident in this dress. Read more",
