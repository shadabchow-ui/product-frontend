        "body": "So I LOVE this color and fabric but,... the fit is a little off. I ordered another dress like this in pink it looked like the same style and I loved that one, but this one fits weird from below the bust to the hips, it's loose but shaped weird, not very flattering, needs to be more flowy in that area instead of boxy. The dress also runs a little small because I got a medium in all the other dresses I order on Amazon but this one is a little tight and short, definitely feels like a small or xs compared to the other mediums I have ordered. The fabric weight is nice and heavy so great for a winter party! Very functional for winter because it is warm and thick. I think it's a great value if this shape fits you because the fabric is beautiful and I really wish it fit, I had to return it and went with a different dusty blue dress for my friends baby shower!
