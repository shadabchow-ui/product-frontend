        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great fit if you focus on the tie and not the button.",
        "body": "The dress is nice overall, if you can get the fit right. The button doesn't work for me, which i saw several reviews mention an issue with the button. Maybe it comes down to body shape, I am 5'6 150lb, I ordered a medium which did fit perfectly. But I have a broad upper body and mid, I do not have a narrow waist. So trying to use the button just made the dress pull away. If the button went through all layers, it would work but it attaches to the inside layer, causing it to not sit right. BUT, I did find a solution. The wrap tie that goes through the dress --- pull tightly on that tie, and make it as snug as possible. This will pull the wrap over and hold it in place. Then wrap it around and tie it. No issues once I figured that out. I think the dress will work for anyone if you pull the tie tightly through the hole in the dress, (as designed) and tie it snugly. It seems complicated but it really isn't. The dress quality is nice. The fabric is heavy and sturdy enough to feel like a nice quality dress. It does not look cheap, it's not a cheap t-shirt material. It's a solid casual, work friendly, cocktail quality dress. I didn't notice any smells, and there were no parts that were see through. For the price, the dress punches above it's weight, if you can get around the weird button design by wrapping it tighter. Even doing so, it does not feel uncomfortable or too snug. I would recommend.

        "body": "Ordered this for a funeral based solely on color (black), fabric (stretchy), cost (inexpensive), and delivery speed (fast) as I needed something in a hurry that would hopefully require minimal alterations before the sudden event. I'll break this review into a few parts. Firstly, can't complain about something that looks decent and costs under $50. If I had more freedom of choice I might have gotten one of the sale prints but the event determined the need for subdued. Received it in two days, giving me enough time to wash it before wearing. Secondly, the fabric is a slinky kind of knit, not too thin but not too heavy. It was tolerable outdoors in triple-digit-heat-index weather. It had great movement too; I didn't feel at all restricted climbing into and out of a tall vehicle, and while walking/standing all day. For me it required a sweater indoors, but the funeral parlor was admittedly kept cold. After washing and drying, I hung it up and didn't need to iron; it also showed no wrinkles at the end of wearing all day. Thirdly, the fit. I'm short with an Unfortunately Sized bust; I have to fit everything to that part of the anatomy and hope I can make enough alterations elsewhere to not look horrible. This is a true wrap dress and that aspect helped me in getting a decent fit at waist and hips. The armholes for me gapped a little; the shoulders are a little too tall (admittedly my shoulder-to-bust distance is shorter than most manufacturers cut and I always have this problem). I wore a black bra underneath to minimize any undergarment peek but I'll need to make a formal alteration at some point. Sleeves would have solved this problem but I didn't want to go with longer sleeves in the warm weather. I also needed to add two safety pins: one next to the button for security — my button held fine but I didn't want to tempt fate based on some experiences in other reviews here — and one where the neckline overlapped as leaning forward caused the front to gap indecently open. A person with a smaller bust might not have as much of a gap problem but the more generously endowed may consider the mighty safety pin. A small snap added to the overlap would also solve the gap problem. Overall I have no complaints as this did everything I needed it to do, and comfortably enough to consider ordering the dress in another color. Read more",

I live in a hot tropical country and it was perfect for the weather. The fit was perfect. There is just one minor issue and that's the button. It kept slipping out of the buttonhole so I used a pin the day I wore it however I will adjust the buttonhole to eliminate that problem. I may buy another colour. The price is excellent right now.

        "body": "The media could not be loaded. This dress is cute!!! I didn’t even iron it today before wearing it.I got this in an XL and I wear a 16-18. It hides my belly, which I appreciate it’s versatile sizing wise if I’m feeling a little puffier, the wrap dress is going to cover that and if I’m less puffy, the wrap dress is going to adjust to that, too. I think I’m going to order more in other colors. The color I got is different for me, and not a color I normally wear, but I decided to try something different and love it! By the way, the material is lightweight, but the dress is great quality, wonderful, hemming and stitching all over even the point where you wrap it has a hole sewn in for the internal part of the belt to go through and wrap around you instead of a button or a little string on the inside to get the wrap effect. I’m amazed by this dress. If you’re on the fence, definitely buy this dress! Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Navy, Tan Animal Print, Dark Pink, Burgundy, Black, Brown Floral Print, Blue Daisy. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
