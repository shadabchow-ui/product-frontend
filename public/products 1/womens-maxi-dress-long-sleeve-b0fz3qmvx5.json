        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars REALLY nice, 2 notes: runs a little too oversized & neckline is a bit tight",
        "body": "This sweater is incredible and almost perfect. The material is super soft and it’s pretty heavyweight, it will keep you warm on a fairly cold day. As others have noted it’s a bit more oversized than you would expect. I am 5’7” 165 lbs ordered my regular size L, and I like the way it looks but I would note that the arms are so long that the tips of my fingernails just barely poke out when standing with my arms down, and the arms are also extra baggy. The sweater is a little long on me, it’s more like tunic length. I think the way it fits would make it perfect for pairing with leggings. So it does run a little extra oversized but I don’t mind it personally af all. The other thing I would note is mostly for anyone who has sensory issues or for any reason struggles with necklines that are a bit too close to the neck, that this runs tighter / closer to the neck than most crew neck sweaters. It feels more like a turtleneck as far as the feeling at the neck and at first I was bummed as I wasn’t gonna be able to wear it. However it’s a rather stretchy material so I manually stretched the neckline for about a minute and put it back on and it helped a lot, although it’s still a little tighter than I prefer, I can handle it now. But if you are able to wear things like turtlenecks than this won’t be an issue for you at all, unless you are sensitive to clothes around your neck it otherwise is unlikely to be noticeable. I just wanted to mention this for anyone else that might have neckline sensitivities like I have. They’re the only two issues I had with an otherwise perfect sweater! Since I don’t mind it running a little extra oversize at all and I was able to fix the neck line issue so that it’s tolerable for me, I really don’t have any problems with this sweater at all. In fact, it is one of my absolute favorites for the rare cold days where I live. But if you don’t have neckline sensitivities and would prefer a more traditionally oversize fit, you may want to consider ordering this one size down from your normal sweater size. But the fabric, material, style, color etc are all perfect and match the seller’s photos. Hope this helps! Read more",

        "body": "I bought this sweater for me and even after washing found it way too big. In a sweater I normally wear XL to allow for other garments to be worn under. This sweater swalloed me up! My husband is 6'4\" and so I had him try it on. It fits perfect! While advertised for women, it's not particularly girly and so he will wear it. In this respect, I'd call it uni-sex. The sweater is really very nice. The weave is even and consitent. The seams are well sewn and tight. The edging is nice. Against bare skin it's a little scratchy - kind of like wool but less so. There is a band running down the back giving it a nice touch. Though not being used as intended, this nice sweater, I predict, will see many a cold mornings in the near future! Read more",

        "body": "A little too big and sloppy for my taste, but that's the style now. I love the warm color--light tan, slightly more brown than khaki or beige. Feels like wool, but isn't (even a little bit of wool makes me itch.) I'd give it a higher rating if it listed the fiber content. Although it says handwash, it machine-washes up fine on cold & delicate, and laying out flat it dries without wrinkles. Otherwise, it seems to wrinkle pretty easily if you don't fold it up carefully. Good for weekends, feeling under the weather, or extra warmth over slimmer sweaters. Read more",

It's perfect for lazy days, running errands, or layering under a jacket. It is great for tucking into jeans or leggings. Honestly, this sweater is a wardrobe essential. Would totally recommend!

        "body": "This oversized crewneck sweater has turned into one of those pieces I keep reaching for without thinking about it. The fabric feels really soft and cozy, and it does a good job of keeping warmth in on colder days. I’ve washed it a few times now and it’s held its shape well, which isn’t always the case with softer knits. The relaxed fit works nicely on its own and leaves enough room to layer underneath. It looks just as good with jeans as it does with leggings, so it’s easy to throw on for different situations. I also like the ribbed cuffs and hem since they add a little structure without feeling tight. Overall, it’s comfortable, easy to wear, and fits right into everyday rotation. Read more",
