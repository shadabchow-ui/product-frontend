        "body": "Adrianna Pappel always makes a stunning dress, and this dress IS stunning. I chose the gunmetal colored dress in size 8, and as usual it fits very true to size. I'm 5'4\" and 155lbs, and wear a size 8 in regular clothes. I'm wearing a corset and shapewear to hide my tummy, and as form fitting as this dress is, you couldn't tell what I was attempting to hide under it. It is VERY long (I'm in 5\" heels) but I never tripped over the length, nor did anyone stand on the train, remarkably! The entire night I received a TON of compliments. I've pictured another dress by Adrianna Pappel (blue) in a side by side of this dress for comparison. Between the two, I'm thrilled I went with this one! As usual with this designer, the beading is quite detailed and sparkly, which makes the dress heavier than most. I happen to LOVE the weight of her dresses and wear it more like armor than something dainty. Highly recommend! Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
