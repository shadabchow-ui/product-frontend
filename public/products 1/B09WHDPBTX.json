        "body": "HONEY🔥🔥🔥! This dress is EVERYTHING! It was a last minute purchase for a wedding. It arrived the next day and it is beautiful! Stretchy satin material that's so classy for a special event. It hugs in the right places and camouflages where needed. I didn't have to constantly adjust it when walking standing or sitting. It was light weight but NOT thin. It has an invisible zipper in the back that was very sturdy. The length is perfect and the split is very tasteful. The size chart is correct. I'm 5'9\" 199 to 201 and I ordered a XL but I could have worn a Large. If you prefer a tighter fit you may consider going down. The XL was a little big in areas (across my chest but I'm not top heavy). Around my waist the ruching was a little lose. But neither of these are a flaw of the dress. This dress is a show stopper and I was the \"It Girl\" at the Wedding! Read more",
