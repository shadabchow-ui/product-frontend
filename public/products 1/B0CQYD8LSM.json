        "body": "I’m 5’1”, a solid size 12, with a small gut. This dress fit perfectly, like a glove! The cut is very flattering (and forgiving.) It is a tad bit long on me, as expected, but a pair of heels will fix that. I’m very impressed with the quality and overall appearance of this dress. (Plus, there’s no weird “chemical” smell as there is on some other garments I purchase through Amazon.) I can hardly wait to wear this stunning dress and will be back soon to order another in a different color! Read more",

        "body": "Needed a dress for my nephew's formal wedding. I ordered many dresses and returned them. I was just about to give up, until this dress arrived. It fit perfectly except that it was a few inches too long- it required a simple hem. The dress was very comfortable as well. It was not too low cut- I didn't have to worry about my bra straps showing or have to keep constantly adjusting anything. The slit in the leg was cut so that I could sit easily without showing too much skin. This dress hit the sweet spot of being appropriate for a church wedding, with glamour, class and a bit of sex appeal. Perfect dress for a formal wedding. Highly recommend! Read more",
