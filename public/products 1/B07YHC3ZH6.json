        "body": "I’d been looking for a cute, cozy dress for chilly winter days, not having the best luck with it but am pleasantly surprised by this dress. Got the Dark Gray color, size L. The fabric feels nice, like a comfy t-shirt. For a minute I thought it might actually be made of cotton, but the tag confirms “95% Polyester 5% Spandex”. I would not say the fabric is thick but it’s not thin and see-thru either. I’d like it to be a little thicker, but it’s not bad. It’s got a good stretch. The sleeves are the perfect length on me. The neckline opening is not so low that I feel exposed and cold up top. I’m 5’7 and the hem length falls right at the bottom of my knees. The bodice seam is pretty much in line with the bottom of my bra, which is exactly where I hoped it would be. (In the main listing photo the bodice seam appears to be lower.) All in all, I find the fabric to be of decent quality, and the style and color to be nice looking and comfy. It’s a good dress for layering. I haven’t worn it outside yet, but I tried it on with some super cozy fleece lined tights (also bought on Amazon), a crocheted scarf and a light jacket and felt very comfy in my 60° house. I would have liked to wear it today, were it not for one thing: Before I even opened the plastic bag it was packaged in, I could smell a very strong perfume on it. It’s the type of perfume scent that laundry detergent, dryer sheets or air fresheners have. The dress was folded and packaged nicely but I wonder if all the dresses smell like that or did someone previously wear it and wash it? Being sensitive to perfumes, it gave me a headache almost immediately so I hung it up by itself to air out. The scent is still really strong after about 8 hours of airing. I’ll probably have to wash it before wearing. Read more",

What started as a dress to do Christmas photos in turned into a repeat dress the next year in a different color and this year I’ve bought several since we moved to a cooler area. I dress it up, and it’s still casual enough. It fits well and is a thin but not see through stretchy cotton WITH POCKETS. It’s flattering on my mom-bod. I’m 5’6” and 240lbs and got a 2xl. It’s smooth and fitted across the bust but flows and comfy everywhere else. Read more",

It's 95% polyester. 🥵 Combined with the tight long sleeves...🥵 The fabric is thin, though. • The bodice was getting a rough texture/kind of pilling the first day. It hasn't been washed yet and is looking like I've owned and washed it a year. 😥 It was $15, so I'm not out a bunch; but honestly, even though it's warm, I would have bought another because it's so comfy/easy to wear.

        "body": "I'm 5'4'' so the waist drops down to my actual waist and doesn't fit as an empire waist dress. The hem falls about four inches past my knees as well. But I still like the fit! I washed in cold and hung to dry before I wore it. The wash didn't seem to change the shape or fit of the dress at all so that was great. Noticed no pilling. It's super soft and stretchy and the pockets are deep and functional. I held my phone, earpods, a lighter, and a vape pen in them and there was no bulk or noticeable weight pulling my pockets down. This worked well on a cold day paired with leggings. Could be layered. Could be worn between cold and warm seasons as well. I'm ordering another one :) Read more",

        "body": "If I could give it a zero I would! I am a true medium this dress in the back is cut like it’s for a child. The back is so hiked up I don’t have problems with clothes like this ever! I was going to wear it to church tomorrow with boots and leggings but it’s a joke! What a waste of money!!! I always take out the tape measure I have one in my beside table drawer and my husband is the measurer I go right by the chart! It’s the back section to the neck it’s so short it jacks up the whole dress! Don’t buy this it’s trash! Sadly this is my favorite plaid to wear around the holidays! My granny taught industrial sewing we all were taught all machines and quality as well it’s like this dress came from a seconds sweat shop! Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",
