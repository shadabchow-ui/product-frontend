I knew the top wouldn’t stay in place very well when I bought it but I didn’t realize that even with permanent fashion tape and freaking pins it still won’t stay in place. I bought this dress as a wedding guest and every 30 seconds I’m fixing the top. Absolutely do not buy unless you’re good at sewing and can fix the top to stay in place. And I’m not talking it shifts a little I mean the entire top rolls up and touches my chin. It’s giving Disney villain with the big ahh collars. Read more",

        "body": "I wore this dress to my friend’s wedding, and let me just say—it made me feel like an absolute princess. As a curvier girl with a little apron belly, I was nervous about how it would sit, but this dress draped beautifully and gave me so much confidence. I got tons of compliments and honestly felt stunning all night. The fabric is a nice heavier quality that feels expensive, but it didn’t weigh me down at all—it was breathable, easy to move in, and perfect for dancing and having fun. I never felt restricted or overheated, which made it such a win for a long wedding day. The only small frustration was that the top part of the dress tends to roll up a bit. I ended up sewing it down myself, which wasn’t a huge deal, but it would’ve been nice if that detail was finished better. Overall, the fit, comfort, and look were everything I wanted. If you’re plus-size and looking for something classy, flattering, and twirl-worthy—this dress is it. Read more",
