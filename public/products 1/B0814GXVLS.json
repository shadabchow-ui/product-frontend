        "body": "I wore this costume to a Halloween party, it was comfortable and fit very well. I’m 5,2” about 145 pounds, and ordered a medium. It fit well and was loose around the belly, which I appreciated as I had hysterectomy surgery 2 1/2 months prior. I could have went down a size otherwise, as there was plenty of room. The dress is made very well and is very beautiful. Probably better than most dance costumes, and beading and sequins stayed in tact. The accessories were absolutely perfect as well! My arms are a bit larger, and the gloves fit perfect. I was skeptical, and completely surprised when the package arrived and everything fit perfectly. Read more",

        "body": "What I liked about the product is that the measurements were exact. I’m 5 foot 10 and I weigh 240 pounds and I have a large bust. I was a little, worried, the 3xl would be too big in the gut and too small around the bust. I’m a size 18L in dress and pants. However, it had just enough stretch to zip up and not be uncomfortable. I will say that the back was a little short for being a tall girl, so I had to wear capris underneath because even a little bend was showing butt cheeks. The quality was nice and got compliments. I chose not to wear the gloves that came with it. The fingers were kind of tight and I wanted to have my fingers free. The pearl bracelet did snap one of its string of beads. The headband was pretty tight, but I do have a big head. Lol I didn’t wear the tights because they’re just for the legs. I needed something to hold them up. So I purchase different ones. I also did not wear the earrings because I am allergic to trace metals but they looked solid. The long cigarette thing kept losing its pieces so I recommend glueing before using. Overall for the price, I’m still pleased with the dress it is hanging up in my closet. Read more",

        "body": "Cute! I got the white with silver and it’s cute! There are strange details if you look close enough- for example the tulle was cut away like I did it, crooked and choppy but literally NO ONE is gonna notice except you (i uploaded a photo). The gloves actually fit me and we’re tight and slim! Juuuust fit my longish fingers but I didn’t wear them cause it was hot. They seem well made! but if you were any larger or had any arm strength at all then you probably couldn’t put them on. The feather headband was very cute and the pearl strand was a mandatory accessory. I didn’t know how to wear it but I saw another girl with tied pearls in a knot so I copied! The bottom of the pearls though fell off, and the separator has some rhinestones glued on upside down! Doesn’t matter cause the separate fell off too. The whole strand didn’t come off, just the end pieces, so it didn’t look too strange. The pearl bracelet was okay. I didn’t wear the earrings because they seemed a little too out of place and not era accurate (I’m not a history buff but I know my jewelry), but they might be fun to give someone. Overall, it had everything you needed, and if you’re pressed for time, or don’t want to buy all the stuff one by one, it’s a good deal! i felt I looked pretty good considering everyone at the party had other amazon dresses on too! I will say the arm hole seems to sit weird, I’m not sure if maybe you were more blessed in the chest, that it would’ve fixed that? (I’m B cup). Also I would’ve liked it to be a lot shorter but I’m not sure that’s period accurate and I’m shorter than most so it’s probably perfect on someone closer to 6ft. I’m 6’2” 110lbs size XS and I got a S 1 wasn’t too loose or too tight (20s dress should swing!) Read more",

        "body": "5'6\" 36C and this dress fit nearly perfectly (It was just a hint loose on top and just a hint snug on the bottom, but most dresses are on me). Ordered this as a Halloween costume, but I'm very impressed with the quality of the dress and will likely wear it without the props for a formal event. The dress itself is well made, and the beading on the dress is sequins and glass seed beads (not plastic beads or trim). The dress stretches enough to accommodate an extra ~inch around the hips or bust, but I wouldn't recommend counting on much more than an inch of stretch or you may break some of the beading threads. I was surprised to see the beading on the headband was also glass/crystal, all other jewelry was plastic beads (although nice looking plastic beads). The gloves and fishnets were ok, the cigarette was pretty cheap and the white end kept falling off. Overall, I think the value was excellent compared to what you would find at a costume shop or even if you were shopping for a stand-alone dress. Tip: - The dress is a sheath dress, so if there are certain parts of your body that you don't want to show off you may want to consider wearing a corset or spanx underneath Read more",
