        "body": "I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding. This dress was soooo comfortable and also fit so close it made me feel like I didn't need on a support garment. Material was not thin and cheap like so many other of the new affordable dresses usually are. It fit me so well I am looking to purchase one in another color. It fit my plus size curves just right. I felt & looked good! I initially had concerns about the size. So I ordered the 3xl early in case I would need to go up a size. But it has lots of stretch so I didn't need to go up to the 4. The 3 fit great. I'm 5'5 & almost 300lbs, with the bulk of my weight being in the butt & thighs area. I also have chunky arms & a \"fupa\", but this dress held it all together nicely. Once I added the support garment underneath, that was the cherry on top. Read more",

Fits a bit shorter than the girl in the photo, but I am 5'8 and extremely long in the torso, so take that into consideration.
