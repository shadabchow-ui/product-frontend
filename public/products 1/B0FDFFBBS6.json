        "body": "Love the dress, the fit, the fabric, the style. Perfect selection for my high school reunion. I’m 5’5 and 135 lbs, in my sixties and a medium was perfect for me. I like my clothes to be roomy not tight. Wore it with high black suede boots. The only thing that I would have preferred was maybe an additional inch longer. Dress value looks more because of the details like gold buttons and it’s lined. Fabric flows and print was beautiful. This is a dress you can dress up or wear causally with sandals or flats. It’s a standout!! Read more",

Cons: • 🔘 The Belt: The belt isn’t the best quality—it feels a bit flimsy—but it’s still usable and does the job if adjusted right. Overall: This dress is perfect for both casual and semi-dressy occasions. With its bold colors and comfortable fit, it’s an easy favorite despite the minor belt issue. I’d definitely recommend it!!
