The second time I wore it, I used a pair of yellow canvas shoes I got here, and it looked so well! You can dress it up or down. The first time, I wore it with a cardigan and nice shoes, and it looked dressy. I wore it for work and for church which means it’s versatile. The best is that it’s not hot! It didn’t seem see through, but I wore it with shape-wear under it in my skin color. The fabric is light. It has pockets! I am 5’9” and wear size 16-18. I bought a XXL. It fit perfectly. Read more",

You can tell this dress was made with care. The seams are neat and sturdy and the fabric is thick enough to be sturdy and light enough to be cool in the heat! The dress is stretchy and easily accommodated my growing pregnant belly! The style is adorable, you can wear it casually and with a cute pair of cowgirl boots it makes a great outfit for church. The size is dead on and the dress has beautifully hidden POCKETS! This dress is a steal and I want it in every color. The value for the cost is amazing I highly recommend this dress! Read more",

I bought black, olive, and the orange/rust color, and it seems that the olive doesn't fit as well. It's tighter in the top and the seam around the top is also uncomfortable (itchy/scratchy)--I think maybe because it's tighter.

Unfortunately, both times I ordered it, there were two perfectly square patches on each side of the chest area that had a brownish tinge to them.

        "body": "I love feeling put together when working from home. During breaks I sometimes run errands or walk my dogs. At 5 pm I want to be ready to run out the door. This dress is casual, inexpensive, cool in summer, looks great on Zoom and very comfy. The perfect house dress. I feel like I could easily wear in the fall with a sweater or scarf to change it up. I'm 5'8\" and it hits just below the knee. I would not want it any shorter. One reviewer said she thought the top seam was too high. I found that wearing the right bra with the right lift made a huge difference. I got a denim blue color and am considering purchasing more in other patterns/shades. I seriously would like several for an easy to grab and get dressed WFH wardrobe. It's better than I expected, given the price. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress V Neck is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",
