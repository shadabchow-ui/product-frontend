        "body": "I'm obsessed with this denim dress! The puffy sleeves are everything, and it's so perfect for summer. The bows are definitely on trend right now so that's such a cute added touch. I wear a tank top underneath mine so I'm not showing skin plus it gives this dress a pop of color. It's so easy to change out whatever look you're going for by switching up what you wear underneath to peek through. It's comfy, breathable, and I feel so effortlessly chic in it. It's perfect to wear everywhere from picnics in the park to brunch with the girls. The roomy pockets are a game changer, and it's so comfy for everyday wear. It's seriously easy to just throw on and go out the door without having to worry about it being wrinkled. Even after washing and drying a few times, it still looks amazing! For me it fit true to size and the denim has a nice weight to it. It's not flimsy feeling whatsoever like some other denim outfits I've ordered online. I'm very happy with my purchase! Read more",

The top can be left open or also tied up more modestly. I like to wear mine with a tank top underneath. I bought this dress in large because of comments that the bust fit small but I think my usual medium would have been fine. I wear 34D for reference and have quite a bit of room in the large. The sizing and fit is pretty forgiving so large is fine. One of my favorite features of this dress is the deep pockets that I find practical for carrying my phone, keys, etc. The denim is high quality, with nice weight to the fabric. I’m loving the resurgence in denim fashions lately and this unique dress is something I will get a lot of wear from. Read more",
