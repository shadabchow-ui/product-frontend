Not scratchy or stiff at all. There is a lot of elastic return when the material is pulled so the shape stays well in place all day. The size fits as a relaxed oversized top. You could size down one and still be fine if you wanted a little more sculpted look. The look is a relaxed look but not frumpy. I wear shirts under or tank tops with most all my tops. This top would look best with an untucked button up collar style shirt under. It works well with both dress pants and jeans. I hope they add additional colors as I would like to buy more. Read more",

        "body": "This is a nice sweater. Much better than I expected. I have ordered other Amazon Essentials, crew neck sweaters that were not as nice at all. (Very thin and pilled in one wearing.) I usually wear a large in tops and I ordered a large in this sweater. It’s an oversized, boxy fit. I probably could have got away with a medium but even then it would still have a loose, boxy look. This doesn’t seem like a style that would cling to your body unless you really sized down. I decided to try the large and figured I could wash or dry if I needed to shrink it up a little. I’m 5’4”, athletic build and probably could wear it with leggings as it does cover my backside. I haven’t needed to wash it yet so I can’t comment if this is even going to be an issue. I would say it’s medium weight, dense knit. It does have this fuzzy/mohair look and feel. It seems anytime I buy this type of knit there is pilling. I haven’t worn it enough to see if pilling is going to be an issue. And if there is pilling, the mohair look does not do well with a fabric shaver. (At least on other sweaters I’ve tried to use a shaver-almost like it would need a sweater ‘brush’) I would say it’s a cool tone pink—doesn’t look lilac or purple to me. I ordered the gray and would like to see it in other colors. I don’t find it itchy but I wear a tshirt or LS shirt underneath and typically am not sensitive to wool or sweaters in general. I will update my review if there are any issues with washing or pilling. Read more",

        "body": "This is a really cute and comfortable sweater. I normally wear a small, ordered a small, and while it does feel roomy, it’s clearly meant to be an oversized fit — so I’d still consider it true to size for the style. The charcoal heather color is especially nice and looks way cuter in person than I expected from an Amazon Essentials piece. The material has a good amount of stretch and bounces back well, which helps it keep its shape. It’s soft with a little bit of bulk to it and is definitely warm enough for cooler days. It is slightly itchy, but I always wear it with an undershirt and it’s nowhere near the most irritating sweater I’ve owned. Once layered properly, it’s not an issue at all. The sleeves stay up when pushed to the elbows, which is a nice touch, and it pairs really well with jeans for a casual, pulled-together look. Overall, I wasn’t expecting something this cute from Amazon Essentials, but this one surprised me in a good way. Comfortable, warm, and stylish enough for everyday wear. Recommended. Read more",

Jeans and tennis shoes, absolutely! Is it a good value? Maybe so. The fit was really awkward on me. The sleeves do not go all the way to my wrist, they seem short-ish. It is also a boxy fit, so maybe not very flattering, and though the material seems quality, it is very itchy/scratchy. I will wear it with a layer underneath and probably push the sleeves up a bit to disguise the shortness. For reference, I am a size 10US and 5'5\". I ordered a size large. Read more",

Being oversized as described, the sleeves are long enough to keep all but her fingertips nicely covered and warm. The collar is a perfect fit as well without bunching up or stretching. It’s holding up quite nicely in our three cats and a grandbaby household. I also love the look on her as dark heather charcoal gray is my favorite color, and for the price (around $30) it’s very well priced for what you get so I’ll be watching for more color choices later, maybe some blues or greens would be nice, if you’re listening!
