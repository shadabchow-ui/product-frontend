        "body": "Ok so oh my God I love this dress so much!!! The pictures really don't do it justice at all. I ordered it last minute for a wedding I got invited to days before and it did not disappoint. I put it on, it fits like a glove, made me look so gorgeous, the material is stretchy and soft so it hugs all the right places and get this - TWO glasses of red wine got spilled all down the front of me that night - NO STAINS. Of course this could partially be because of the color I chose but I just blotted with a napkin and the spill was just gone a few minutes later! After a gentle cycle in the washing machine and air drying, it's like nothing ever happened. Im gonna be ordering this in every color because I literally have never put on a dress I love more than this one. Get it get it get it!!! (For reference I am about 5'8\" and 140 lbs with D cups and an athletic build starting broad shoulders, so if you're built similarly to me, this will look fabulous on you!) Read more",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that I believe it could have been used prior and someone returned it. When I went to lightly press it the bottom of the dress had water stains. It was the dark blue so you could not notice it unless you were close up. I didn’t have time to return it because I ordered it last minute for a Wedding. Read more",
