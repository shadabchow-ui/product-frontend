        "body": "LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress!! I bought it to wear to the Moulin Rouge musical, and wow—it delivered. I did a ton of research beforehand and was a little nervous based on the reviews, but I’m so glad I gave it a try. Based on the size chart and my 36D bra size, I ordered the size Large. Yes, getting into it is a challenge—and yes, that zipper is no joke. Even with the hook closures, my husband and I couldn’t get it zipped while it was on me. The only way it worked was to zip it most of the way up first, and then shimmy into it (about 3 inches from the top, then slide in). Once it was on… holy WOW. It hugged all the right places, gave my chest a flattering lift (huge win for this mama of two), and the built-in shapewear smoothed everything out beautifully. I got so many compliments that night. Two of my friends literally ordered it after seeing me in it! It was surprisingly comfortable to sit and wear all night, which I wasn’t expecting from such a sculpting piece. And major bonus points for the bathroom-access hole—no wrestling out of the whole dress needed! Absolutely gorgeous, flattering, and makes you feel like a goddess. Just be ready for a little gymnastics getting into it 😂. Read more",
