        "body": "I ordered 2 sizes of the same shirt (white) small and medium. The SMALL fit perfectly all around except for the bust area. It’s a tiny bit snug, but just a little bit. You can see from the photo how it pulls just a little . 5ft 2in (38” bust circumference 30” waist, 38” hips) I could have kept the small and been happy with the way it fit but I also ordered a MEDIUM . The medium fit better at the bust and the rest of the garment is a little more roomy but not significantly so. Overall, I found the medium far more comfortable so I chose to keep it and I returned the small. The fabric tags claims 65% cotton 35% polyester but feels more like polyester. It is a very casual and nice lightweight garment with a lot of flowiness. The white version is just a tad transparent so nude colored underwear is advised. Read more",

I'm guessing a box cutter could have made that happen. Now it is too late to return it, but thought I'd warn others. Check for things like this before you lose your chance to return! I know I will.
