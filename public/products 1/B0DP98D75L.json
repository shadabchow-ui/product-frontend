It is so comfortable, it is super cute, it has pockets, the length is really good and it has these cute little slits on the sides that don’t go up too high, but just high enough that you feel cute! The fabric is very soft, the dress itself is very sturdy, and I even wear it with leggings. I wore it when we were flying home, it’s so comfortable. I wore it on the airplane. I will probably buy a couple more of these! I got the blue and white flower one. Read more",

        "body": "I’m 5’4”, 42DD, 195 and I ordered the Floral Bohemian print in an XL. It fits great and the color is vibrant. The dress is soft and has stretch but it just lays nicely over my body. Not clingy at all, but more on the flowy side. The V neck is perfect, not a plunging neckline, it’s modest imo, which I really like. I do not like my cleavage showing and it does not show with this dress. I took one star off due to the side splits being too high. The splits come about 1 1/2 inches above my knee so when I sit and cross my legs, I’m constantly pulling the dress to make sure my thighs are covered. This is an inexpensive dress that is more casual but with certain prints or solids, you can definitely dress these up for special occasions. The quality seems good and at a fair price. Find your size and a color/print you like and have some fun in thus comfy flowy dress. Read more",

        "body": "I was impressed with the weight of the fabric of this dress. It is not thin or see through and doesn't stick to the body like thinner fabrics do. The color was true to the picture. I was also pleasantly surprised with the pockets. Normally side pockets on the hips can be bulky looking but because of the styling of the dress and the fabric, they are barely noticeable. The v-neck isn't revealing but shows enough skin to be able to display a necklace. I also like that the shoulder isn't narrow - definitely good bra coverage. The dress is a smidge long for me without shoes at 5'5\" - almost touches my feet. But it would fine with even a small heel and would be great for taller gals. I bought this for a tropical vacation and I think it will work well as a coverup around the resort and also an option for going to dinner with sandals and a nice necklace. Recommend! Read more",

I’m 5’4”, 138 lbs & I purchased a medium. The length didn’t look good on me. It fit well above the waist, however from the waist down the dress becomes wider & is too much fabric for me. I tried it with a belt but that didn’t look so great either. I will be returning & continue looking for a cute sundress. Hopefully it will fit others better than me. Read more",

        "body": "Really thrilled with this maxi casual dress which is SO comfortable for wearing in hot weather. It fits true to size in a large (for reference purposes I’m 5’8” tall weighing about 155 pounds). I find the dress extremely flattering ………..not too tight but also not too loose either. I’m impressed with the vibrant color patterns and have ordered more than one dress due to them being so comfortable, fitting well and being perfect for not just summer but for year round because of living in a warm climate. The colors of the dresses and the patterns are all attractive and I’ve received compliments from people I don’t know who have said to me how pretty they are. I like how the dress has 2 side slits at the bottom giving a unique look and the 2 pockets are great too. Very important is the fact these dresses are a terrific value cost wise - another reason I’ve more than one of them. I liked that the dresses were reasonably affordable. These maxi dresses can be dressed up or not depending on foot ware - high heels versus flip flops and what jewelry is worn. Overall, I’m totally delighted with these dresses and highly recommend them! Read more",
