Anytime I wear it, I keep having to try to pull it down away from my neck. I probably wouldn't buy it again knowing this. However since I have it and it looks so cute and is comfortable other than the neck line I will still continue to wear it. It has a nice flowiness to it and the length is really nice. I don't have to worry about bending over and it being too short, but it's also not ridiculously long. I ordered both the white and the black one. The white/ creamish one has a slip underneath it that's built in. Absolutely amazing!! However it does make the cream one a little bit thicker and warmer. Read more",
