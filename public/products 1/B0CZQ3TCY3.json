The fit-and-flare style is incredibly flattering without feeling tight, and the high-low hem gives it a dressy feel without being over the top. The fabric has a nice weight to it and moves beautifully in photos. I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it was—I could move around easily and didn’t feel restricted at all. The sizing was accurate, and the dress looked just as pretty in person as it did online. If you need something elegant but not too formal, this is a great choice.
