        "body": "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this dress. The material feels soft, stretchy, and comfortable, and it hugs the body in a very flattering way without feeling tight. The wrap style and the pleated details give it an elegant look that works perfectly for work, dinner, or any special occasion. The length is classy, the sleeves fit nicely, and the stitching looks well done. The color is exactly as shown and looks even prettier in person. I received several compliments the first time I wore it. Overall, this dress is stylish, comfortable, and worth the price. I would definitely recommend it. Read more",

He said it hugged my curves “in all the right places,” and the color was “totally hot.” OK. That’s a definite win! Got it for an upcoming cruise, and I will feel very confident when I wear it. The fabric is substantial, not at all see-through. It didn’t arrive with a lot of wrinkles, and it appears to be a type of fabric that doesn’t look like it will wrinkle easily. There is some stretch to it. It is well constructed, no split seams. I ordered the size S, and the fit is good, just slightly big in the waist, but perfect everywhere else. Taking it in for a custom fit will be simple. I am going to give it more waist curve by sewing the two back darts a little deeper. Great fit for a bigger bust, although I’m sure it would be fine for an average one, too. For reference, I am 5’5” tall, wear a 34DD and weigh 118 pounds. This impromptu picture was taken without support undergarment (i. e. Spanx, which I normally wear with closer-fitting dresses, just to make certain everything is super smooth when dressing up.)
