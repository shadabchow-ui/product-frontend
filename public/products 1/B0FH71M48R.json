        "body": "This dress is so cute. Perfect just as is or with leggings. The material is so soft and it is so comfortable. It fits true to size. I can wear to run errands, or a sports event or dress up for a special night. The material weight is perfect for any season. It is not see through, but not too heavy either. I love it so much, I have bought in multiple colors and in short sleeve too. They don't wrinkle and I am pleased with the quality of each dress I have purchased. The black is a nice dark black, it has not faded with washing. I also love the blue, the color is vibrant, exactly as pictured, maybe prettier. I hang mine to dry, but I'm sure you could put in the dryer on low heat. They are often on sale, but I would pay full price, a great deal . I get so many compliments anytime I wear one of them. I'm sure I will be buying more. Read more",

I had to use the steamer after washing the first time as creases from initial packaging didn't wash out. Second time washing I didn't need to steam. The material is better than expected. The style almost gives you an hourglass figure due to the way its sewn. I thought it would be more aline. It does run a bit large. Read more",
