        "body": "This dress is so cute and comfortable to wear. Quality material is used. It's stretchy, but not too stretchy to cause that cheap look. The lace isn't itchy either! Professionally made and well sewn. I love the classy blue color. The cons are the dress length and the weird sizing chart that led me to by the wrong larger size XXL. I never wear XXL, but I took the chance based on the chart. You can see what I mean: My bust is 42, waist is 39 and hips 45. I had to return the dress for a smaller XL size. Now that I have the right size, it's still too long by about 2 inches with my 3 inch heels. That's a lot! Because I can sew, I'm hemming it myself. Not hard for me. For this reason, I won't reduce a star. I like this dress that much. Hemming it is an easy fix, making the dress perfect. I can dress it up with accessories, great hair and makeup, and make it pop! I'm 5'2\" and 178 lbs. On the attached pics, the hem is only pinned and the dress is not iron yet. I hope this helps! Read more",

        "body": "I bought this dress for a black tie dinner event. This dress was flattering, and medium fit me well with some smoothing shapewear underneath. I am 5ft 0in, around 140lbs, and not fit. I originally thought the waist was a little too tight when I tried this dress on without shapewear, but the large was too loose and a bit too long. Given my height, I was surprised that the length was OK. I wore heels that were 2.5-3 inches, and the bottom of the dress swept the floor a tiny but, but not enough to trip me. The material looks nice, feels durable, and it has some stretch (except in the band around the waist.) The navy color was pretty. The zipper sticks where the material changes, but not so much that I couldn't zip and unzip by myself while pulling the top or bottom a bit to straighten it out. I was sitting, standing, and walking while wearing this dress, and I think if I was dancing, it could have stretched the top of the slit apart enough to tear, but I can't know that for sure without trying it. Overall I really liked how this dress looked on me and definitely plan to wear it again. I will shop this brand again when I need formal or semiformal dresses such as for weddings and business events. Read more",

        "body": "I gave this a four star because it is what it says it is. The measurements are correct. The problem is that the measurements they have I did not fit in either size large or the extra large. The dress itself looks nice. The lace is soft and has plenty of room without being too roomy in the arms. The skirt part is made out of a heavy kind of material that doesn’t really feel like polyester. The fabric is not stretchy. The dress will not cling to your curves nor will it form to your body. No give for bulges. The V neckline is not as low as I feared. The color was spot on. A very cute dress for the right body type. Read more",

Then after further inspection, there were 3 spots where the stitching was out. So there are 3 holes. I attached pictures. I'm returning it and ordering another one. I'm hoping the next one will be better. I may message the seller too. Also the color is way off. The last picture is from the site. It looks more purple. The pictures I posted look more red.
