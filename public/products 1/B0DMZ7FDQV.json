        "body": "I love this dress. I bought the pink one and the green one. Couple notes: the green one has more coverage and the fabric is more sturdy (youre less likely to have a wardrobe malfunction). It has a lot of give and is form fitting but really comfortable to wear and move around in. I was a large in the green dress. In the pink one, I was a medium. The pink dress uses a lot more stretchy fabric, especially around the bust. The pink one is where you could have a wardrobe malfunction. The fabric attached to the metal ring in between the breasts is the same stretchy material as the rest of the dress. So don't tie the straps too tight, b/c you'll stretch them out. Also if you tie the straps for the bra part too tight, it pulls the bra panels too far apart and you stretch the fabric around that metal circle even more. I wish that fabric in between the breasts were made from a tougher/less stretchy material. That is the only recommendation I'd have to make future versions better. That, and to sew the metal ring in between the breasts in place so the ring can't rotate around. Overall, these dresses are so pretty. I never thought I'd buy, or wear, such a dress, but I'm glad I took the leap. Both dresses are very flattering. Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Boho Brown, Multicolor Floral, Khaki, Blue, Red Leopard, Red and Black, Brown Paisley, Brown Cheetah, Green Multicolor, Pink Flowers, Pink Lily. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
