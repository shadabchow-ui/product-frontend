        "body": "Gorgeous dress, with a very retro-inspired, yet modern cut. Falls and flows wonderfully! This item really flatters the figure while making a bold statement in a beautiful color. Sometimes peacock blues appear either a little washed out or far too green. This fabric strikes just the right balance between them. The sleeves are nicely formed, but here's where I began to take off a star. Two things, either one probably not enough by itself, but together probably add up to a small knock. First, the sleeves themselves were just a tiny bit short. They fell at an awkward place on anyone's arms. At least on me, the sleeves could go just a little longer without affecting the styling and not cut off the arm in the widest spot. If you have wider shoulders, this might not be a problem. Secondly, the buttons. They read \"stewardess.\" Easily changed and probably worth it for such a nice item! Just pointing it out - that might be the look you want, sort of like a men's \"blue blazer\" that has a certain feel regardless of styles and trends. Not a problem, really. Great dress overall! This will go right into the office rotation! Read more",

        "body": "I am really impressed with how well this dress is made. I pulled and tugged on the stitching, and nothing came loose — it’s solidly constructed.All of the buttons on the skirt are decorative, so you can’t customize the opening at the bottom to make it more business-appropriate or casual. However, the two buttons at the top are functional and can be undone if you prefer.I ordered a medium for my sister, and I believe it will fit her nicely. The material has some stretch to it, and the tag indicates it’s made of 95% polyester and 5% elastane. It definitely feels like polyester, so if that’s a fabric you dislike, this may not be for you. The fabric information tag is located at the bottom of the skirt.All of the seams are well done and neatly finished — something I don’t often see in women’s clothing. The rolled-up section on the sleeves is stitched securely in place; while you could unroll it, it would look odd and reveal the elastic seam underneath. Both sleeve buttons are decorative as well.There’s also a zipper that unzips smoothly, but it doesn’t seem to serve much purpose — it runs from just below the armpit to about halfway down the skirt. My guess is it’s intended to adjust the fit slightly.The brand tag includes a sweet message: “Women’s wear — a product line with delicate styling, design, and comfortable fabric. Our collection features classic, timeless patterns. We hope every customer leads a confident, positive lifestyle full of love for themselves and their families. Grace Karen will accompany you every step of the way. Thank you.”Overall, this is a wonderful dress, and I’m confident my sister will love it. I’m very glad I picked it up for her for Christmas.

        "body": "The material is really thick and as nice as it can be for an unlined dress. I really was drawn to the sexy Mad Men kind of style (if you’re old enough to get that reference). Unfortunately I think the fit is not for me but I think it’s more where I carry my weight and not a problem with the dress. If you’re like me and carry weight around the lower middle or have a mommy pouch, you might have the same result as me. I am not wearing any spanx underneath and that could make a difference for some. I do think the color is pretty. The buttons seem sturdy, not like those buttons that feel like they’re going to pop off the second you try to button/unbutton. However I was able to just pull it on/off without using the buttons, there is plenty of stretch. Overall, I think it’s a really great for the right body type. Read more",

        "body": "This is a very nice dress with a polished, elegant look that works beautifully for business occasions, church, or any event where you want to look put together. The color is rich and classy, and the gold buttons add a beautiful touch that elevates the entire outfit. It’s easy to accessorize, making it simple to dress up or keep modest and refined. The fabric quality is impressive, stretchy, comfortable, and smooth against the skin. The fit is lovely and flattering, accentuating your shape without being tight or revealing. The weight of the dress is just right, not too heavy, not too light, and the flow gives it a structured, organized appearance that stays neat throughout the day. Washability is good as well; the fabric holds up nicely and maintains its shape and color. For value for money, this dress is an excellent choice. It looks high‑end, feels great on, and offers versatility for many occasions. A modest, stylish, and beautifully made dress that delivers both comfort and confidence. Read more",
