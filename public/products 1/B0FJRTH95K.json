        "body": "This is a very pretty and well-made dress that is perfect for an event or wedding. I got the black as I tend to go to awards events and similar outings rather than weddings, Unfortunately, size large is not very large. I currently wear a size 12 in pants and a large in tops, and this dress was hilariously small on me. I would guess that size large will fit a woman who wears a size 8 comfortably. Maybe a size 10 at the most. I didn't take pictures with the dress on because it was not something that anyone would want to see. I am currently losing weight, so I hope that I will be able to fit into this beauty at some point. When I was trying it on, my husband came in and commented that he loved the dress, but was it supposed to be open like that on the side? It wasn't; it was the zipper that I could not zip up. Still, it's very pretty, so for ladies who are thinner than I am, this dress is a great option for an elegant and beautiful dress. Read more",

        "body": "This dress is just gorgeous, and so well made! I can't believe it's only $40. I've paid FAR more for dresses of lower quality. I would say it runs just a tiny bit small, only because the fabric has no give or stretch at all. I am currently carrying some extra pounds and it doesn't quite fit right, but at my normal (and ideal) weight I know it's going to look great. I'm not going to ding the dress for my own weight gain, lol. The fabric is not too thick, but it's also substantial (NOT super thin like a slip dress or nightgown). There's a zipper on the side. The stitching is very nice and there were no stray threads anywhere. It arrived with plenty of wrinkles but it'll be easy to steam or iron on low. I now have some extra motivation to shed the extra pounds, because I want to wear this dress at the holidays! It would be a perfect understated piece that I could dress up a bit. The dress would also be appropriate at a wedding, at church, or even at a business cocktail-type event (it's fitted, but definitely suitable for wearing around business colleagues). I'm really impressed by the style, quality, and presentation of this dress. A great Amazon find! Read more",
