The material on the bottom is thinner than I expected and isn’t as long as pictured. The top mesh/beaded area is see through which I couldn’t tell from the pictures provided nor the reviews I saw, but easily fixed with a bodysuit underneath. There were some minor imperfections on the back around the seams, but nothing that anyone noticed. I believe it was tts, and possibly on the short side. I am 5’2, wore with small heels and I didn’t have to hold it up at all (size XL). With all that being said, this was definitely worth the price. I received so many compliments. The dress was comfortable and easy to move in. The slit was high, but not too high that I felt inappropriate. I would recommend and purchase again. Read more",
