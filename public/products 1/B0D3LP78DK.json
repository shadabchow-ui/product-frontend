        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice dress at a good price point.",
        "body": "This is a really nice dress. I did order it one size up from what I normally would wear. It is a maxi on me and I am 5‘4“ tall. With a pair of boots it looks fabulous and I also put a wide waisted belt under the bodice. Bonus! It has pockets and they’re deep. I love the smocking. Don’t hesitate to order this dress. I ordered it in two colors and I’m very happy that I did. It doesn’t have any zippers or buttons and easily slips on over your head. The skirt is gathered layers, but they lay flat and there’s nice flow in the fabric. The only stretchiness is in the bodice where it is smocked. It’s a very comfortable dress that I’m looking forward to wearing. I like the fabric and do not find it too thin. The stress is not lined and that is what I was looking for. The style is slightly little house on the Prairie, but just slightly. The sleeves have elastic at the wrists that is not tight. The sleeves are generous and hit my hand at a nice point. I personally hate sleeves that are too short and I never buy three-quarter length sleeves. So, this dress works out really well for me. I can see that I’m going to be wearing these dresses a lot. I may even order a third dress in a different color. Read more",

        "body": "I purchased the dress in green and white in a pinch for a family friend’s event. Thankfully, I received it within 1 1/2 days of ordering it. (Thanks, Amazon Prime). After receiving it, I tried it on and was extremely pleased with the length (which reaches my ankles), and overall fit of the dress. The bodice, while form fitting, is not too clingy or tight. For reference, I am 5’5” and 125 pounds and ordered the small. The dress is also very light, airy, and ideal for the spring or summer. However, you could totally get away with wearing this during the fall, too. I paired this dress with some white, high-heeled sandals, a hat, and pearl earrings. I liked this dress so much that I ordered it in blue. All in all, I found the dress flattering, attractive, modest, and chic, and would order it for a 3rd time in a heartbeat! Read more",

        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars So Cute But \"Prairie Like\" On Me :(",
        "body": "This is a very pretty dress. In my opinion, the bottom is too frilly. It should not have the three tiers to the skirt as it looks very young and little house on the prairie vibe. The print is cute but not really for older women. I think that if you are in your mid-twenties, you can get away with the print and the skirt. Older women it tends to look like again, a prairie dress or as I was told by a family member, \"looks like an old lady dress or little house on the prairie. Put an apron on and a bonnet and you are good to go!\" This definitely dashed my hopes! I tried on the dress and I wear a size 14/16. Recommend sizing up if you like a little more looseness. The XL was loose but since it is polyester, it will definitely NOT be a dress you want to wear in hot or warm weather. Reserve for cool or wintery weather. The upper bodice and sleeves are well designed and very comfortable. The sleeves are nice and long. I loved the modesty of this dress, but again the tiered bottom is just too much. The pocket placement was perfect. Set to the front as to not add volume to the hips! Well done here on dress design! Sadly, both that In tried are being returned due to the print and the cut of the skirt. I so badly wanted this dress to be a winner for me. If you are younger and more fashion forward, I think this would potentially be a great dress for YOU! Read more",

I love that it's long down to my ankles. It's loose though and fits in all the right places. The top part comes down far enough (not right under my bust) and it is super cute and trendy.
