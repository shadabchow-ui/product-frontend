        "body": "Love the color and I got tons of compliments when I wore it to a conference! Very classy, I love the high neck. It stayed relatively wrinkle-free throughout the day after ironing too! True to size but you could size down if you really want it to snatch the waist. It has the slightest bit of stretchiness; it’s not a completely rigid fabric which I like, it was a comfortable wear for a long day. I accidentally ran it through the laundry without following the care instructions, and nothing happened to the color, shape, seams, etc. Overall a really great dress!! Read more",

        "body": "The dress was absolutely gorgeous and fit beautifully. It was true to size with a great overall feel and flattering look! HOWEVER… I’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars because the fabric stains with practically anything that touches it — even plain water. The dress actually arrived with a few stains already on it, but since my event was just days away, I had no choice but to keep it. After washing, the stains seemed to disappear thankfully, but the moment I brushed against a damp bush, it was instantly ruined again. Once dry, the marks stayed. And don’t even think about sweating — any moisture leaves a visible stain. This is great if you are super careful with it once it’s on and it’s not an event where you will be hot. (I do know this tends to happen with some satins… this is one of those satins. Hahah) Read more",

The dress is really pretty, but it's cumbersome to wear. The color is vibrant and true to the photos; the neckline drapes beautifully over the bust, and the dress feels luxurious against the skin. The fabric is lightweight which is good for spring and summer events. Though it's not see-through, it doesn't pass the belly button test, so shapewear is a must! My biggest gripe was the length not falling the same as the photos on me. If you have hips, gut and butt, the dress will wear significantly shorter. Other cons: the skirt rode up on me, and figuring out what bra to wear with it was a pain. I think if there was a 3XL, it would've flowed the way I envisioned more. Would not purchase again.
