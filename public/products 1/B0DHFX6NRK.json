It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",
