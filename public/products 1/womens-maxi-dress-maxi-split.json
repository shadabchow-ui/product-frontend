        "body": "I am impressed by this little dress. It is a light weight rayon, polyester, spandex material. It doesn’t feel or look cheap. The arm holes have a lining so they don’t gap or show your under clothes. It comes in both a crew neck and a v-neck. I bought both and chose to keep the v-neck as I like this style on me better. I am 5’6.5” and weigh 140. The medium fit me perfectly and it is not form fitting. It fits loosely so doesn’t show all your imperfections but still indents a little at the waist so has shape to it. I only gave this 4 stars vs 5 as I do not know how it wears with washing over time. I bought the navy and ordered a second in the dark coffee. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Maxi Split is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.",
