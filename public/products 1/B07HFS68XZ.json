        "body": "Gonna cut to the chase here: If you want an expensive looking boutique dress, at a price far less than boutique pricing—this is THE dress for you! I was very impressed and beyond pleased with how this dress fit and looked, for a wedding we just attended. Though I obviously don’t have the figure of the young model, as seen in the listing, I really liked how this dress fit me and gained many compliments from others. For the figure I have (I’m almost 61 now) I truly believe the listing photos represent honestly and ethically what you will receive. The fabric is stretchy, so the dress conforms to the way you are shaped. And even better, for a body con gown, I feel it does a great job hiding the little bloopers we all get with age and….well, age lol. The most surprising part for me was how the long ruffle is very much like the listing photo—so long as you do one dreaded or dirty deed: Iron it on a polyester medium setting. This took a bit to do, as the dress arrives quite wrinkled. I ironed it on the “wrong” side so the iron didn’t leave marks on the good side of the dress. It also required some steam and need to repeat some parts with the iron after passing over sections once. If this is a drawback for you, perhaps consider getting the dress professionally steamed. I mean, heck, for the price of this dress, it’s still a reasonable expense if you get this professionally pressed instead of doing it yourself. When I confessed to a few wedding guests what this cost, they were absolutely shocked. Most of them replied that this looks like a $200-300 designer gown. With the fabric being so substantial, I can definitely agree. Even better, it’s not super heavy (so it doesn’t feel too hot when dancing etc) and the overall comfort was excellent. Almost like wearing a jersey material, TBH. The zipper btw is of great quality. Didn’t stick once during my trial fittings or day of wearing to event. There is also a small button in back at top of neck, to keep the halter panel more secure. ⬇️⬇️ TL;DR ⬇️⬇️ If you want to get a $200-300 dress, go ahead…but why, when you can get this? Great comfort, fit, stretch, fabric, exudes classic elegance, and built for just about any figure. (Details to help others w attached photo: I am 5.6 1/2” wearing 3” heels. Weight 148. Wearing unpadded strapless bra and no shaper underneath. Though the slit can be a tad high while sitting, I think I could have worn a shaper after all. But too late now lol) ETA: wore this to yet another wedding and still got a ton of compliments. And washed it in gentle cold in my washing machine. Tumbled on hot steam setting for about 5 minutes and barely have any ironing to do, for my next wear. THIS DRESS IS THE BOMB 💖☺️💖 Read more",
