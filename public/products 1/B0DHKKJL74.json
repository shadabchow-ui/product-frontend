        "body": "Overall: beautiful!!!! So flattering!!! Comfortable as well! Girl, get the dress! As a girl who has never really been into dresses, I find myself often needing one around Halloween. I chose this option, as I wanted to show off my upper half a bit, while still remaining a little modest. The dress is similar to a swim suit material, but it does stretch! It does provide a bit of shaping as well. The dress is not see through! It is well made in my opinion. I did not size up, so that it would hug my body. Up to you to decide which you would prefer! The dress is a LITTLE short in back. I do not have a large behind so keep this in mind if you do. Not a deal breaker, just limited on how much movement you can do at times. Comes vacuum sealed. I expected wrinkles, but there were no noticeable ones once out of packaging. Great dress for the price point. Comfortable and unbelievably flattering. Read more",

I am 5'9 so it is hard to find this type of dress that doesn't expose everything. This dress did not disappoint. Pros: Dress was delivered fast. Fit was absolutely beautiful. Tall girl and curvy girl friendly. Color was amazing and not see through, thankfully. And you can dress this up or down, which is I appreciate. Cons: The only thing negative I would say is about the smell when you open the vacuum sealed bag was absolutely terrible. It smelled like it was shipped form a fish market with some garbage on the side. But easy fix, just washed it with a little vinegar and poof the smell was all gone. Read more",

I wore it for my anniversary date night just a month after having a baby, and it made me feel confident, comfortable, and stylish. The fit was incredibly flattering without being too tight, and it hugged in all the right places while still allowing me to breathe and move comfortably. The fabric felt great and had just the right amount of stretch. My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it didn’t wrinkle so easily—but overall, I absolutely loved it and got tons of compliments.
