        "body": "To begin I’m 5’2 and 120lbs. 34B up top.. I first ordered a medium which was WAY too big. I then returned for this dress in apricot, size small. Better fitting, but the light color mixed with material shows the flaws. What you see pictured is the black in small. Likes- it’s flattering, forgiving, and soft. It was not a bad price for the quality of the dress. Not too thin and definitely not see through. It will be warm when I wear it to a baby shower in February(NJ). Dislikes- it’s still big. Especially in the midsection. But wearable. If they made it in XS I’d definitely size down. I typically wear a small-medium. Plenty of room for my big breasted friends or my big booty Judy’s. Unfortunately I don’t have either of those. Overall I love the dress. A bit bummed I can’t get it smaller to be more form fitting, but it was a great purchase and I’ll keep. Read more",

The dress fit very well, though I could have sized down due to the material’s stretch. The ribbing is a lovely touch, and the fabric is incredibly flattering. I felt confident and elegant at the gala, and the dress definitely suited the event. It’s versatile enough to dress up or down for various occasions. Highly recommend this dress for its quality, fit, and style! Read more",

        "body": "Love, love, love this dress! The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I’ve been dropping a lil’ weight (okay, progress!) and found myself between sizes. So it fit a little loose under the bust. But baby, that wasn’t stopping nothing. I got creative, clipped the fabric together with a pearl clasp at the cutout, and turned it into a moment. Gave it this seamless, chic look that still let the original style shine. Cute and classy, period. The dress is giving simple luxury. It’s perfect for those early spring days when the sun is out but the breeze still has something to say. The fabric feels good on the skin, and that color contrast? A head-turner. I wore it to a baby shower and got compliments left and right—but don’t worry, I kept it respectful. The mama-to-be still had the spotlight… I just borrowed a lil’ glow from the side. If you’re looking for an effortlessly fabulous dress that you can wear as-is or dress up your way, this is that piece. Just keep the sizing in mind if you’re in between, but trust me—it’s worth the tiny tweak. This dress did what needed to be done! Read more",
