        "body": "Update: I returned the item for two reasons. The main reason was on the 2nd time I tried the dress on I noticed black \"dye\" on my hands. It was as if the color from the material was rubbing off. I was discouraged as I really wanted to like this. The second reason was the fit of the neckline. It is not round as pictured, but a poor mock turtleneck that does not look as elegant as the dress could be. For these 2 main reasons, I sadly returned it. I just could not deal with black dye coming off the material. I ordered up a size. Perfect fit. It's body hugging. Not sheer. Nice main material. Very staticy though. Not sure how I can fix that. Suggest wearing all in one underneath as every line will show. My only complaint, if you will...is this neckline. It's weird. Hangs poorly. Looks cheap. If I keep the dress for the black tie affair I have pending, I'll have to have that fixed. I have to drop it to 4* for that. A close 3.5. but...it was under $60. Has a back zip. The slit is not along the side (hip down) but the side front. Better for me but...just a note, not as pictured. Nice for the $ but not worth more. Read more",

Now on to my concerns… upon opening the package, I noticed right away that there are light grey/white marks in a few spots and it’s *extremely* wrinkled. It looks very much like it was a return that someone wore and got deodorant marks all over and then stuffed it back in the bag to return. I checked for a tag- but there’s no tag anywhere along any of the dress seams telling me how to launder it (the Amazon listing says hand wash only and says nothing about ironing). Okay, so I hand wash it and hang it to dry but it’s STILL wrinkly!! I can’t wear this dress like this and I’m potentially going to ruin it by taking an iron to it. That’s a lot of BS for a dress that cost me over $50 and took me almost a week to get. And with shipping times taking so long, I can’t return it and have another dress in time. I’m not thrilled.
