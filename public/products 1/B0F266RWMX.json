        "body": "I bought this dress for a friend’s cocktail attire wedding and let me tell you.. it was perfect!! Just the right amount of class and sexiness, all wrapped together in this stretchy and quite comfortable little number. I went bra-less as the fabric quality is nice and doesn’t show anything through. Love the high slit, but beware if you plan to drop it low on the dance floor- you will show some skin! I got so many compliments on the color (berry) and it was perfect fall standout without being obnoxious. I went with an ordered a small and medium, but kept the small for a more fitted look. The fabric around the middle is very forgiving- which I appreciate as a mom with a little extra in the mid section. Would 100% recommend!! Read more",

        "body": "I bought this dress for a birthday outing with my husband. He told me to wear something fashionable and comfortable shoes so I ordered this even though I didn't know our plans. It is not see-through (at least the red one is not) and the material is comfortable and moves with you. The slit is high so be careful. The cups in the bust area have a slight pointy look and are not seamless. This aspect didn't bother me much but may be undesirable to some people. I didn't have to adjust throughout the night. I wore it with short heels. The front has some ruching which helps hide some imperfections. It doesn't cover the legs or arms so if you're concerned about that, this dress isnt the one for you. It's not a dress that you can easily wear smoothing garments or underwear. The dress was a little long (I'm 5'2\") but it wasn't absurdly long. It would be even better with higher heels. It flowed well throughout the night and felt secure and study. I received a ton of compliments. My husband rented a yacht for us and 50 close friends and we had a great night dancing, eating, and drinking on the water. Read more",

Super comfy, stretchy, a little on the thicker side, and not see through at all. Downsides- the fit was just not it for me. I sometimes bounce between a small and medium. If you’re typically between a medium/large, medium is right for you. The dress was long, even with heals on. Prob an inch longer than it needed to be. The stomach area was loose and floppy- not flattering at all. The back fit VERY well and love the adjustable straps! The cups were just wrong. Way too big (for me) and had little points on them. Even if I did fill out the cups, I’m pretty sure it would still look like nipples! I ordered a size small in hopes that it’ll fit better because I love the idea of this dress, and the material.
