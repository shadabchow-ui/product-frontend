        "body": "The arms are a good fit, but that is where the good ends. Even the fit around the legs is a bit tight for this dress, when it should not be so tight. The legs the fit is okay, it could do with more material to really make it fit, flow and move better. That is where the okay stuff ends with this dress. I was very surprised to have such a tight fit in the hip area, that is not normal for this sort of dress, and my review keeps moving towards the worst parts of this! At the waist where it should be a more smooth flowing transition from tight in the bust to loose at the hips and tons of room in the legs, this fits more like a sheath dress showing off all your imperfections in that area, rather than gliding over them and smoothing them out with a looser fit. The chest is VERY tight, and I'm not that big! I'm only a 38D and planning to go bigger this summer, if I go much bigger this dress may not even fit me! I would say order up a size if you can! If you look at the seams you can easily see the problem. There should be some triangular seems near the hemline, there isn't. When the dress is hanging you should see a slight hourglass shape to it, instead there is nothing but straight seams around the waist. The did stitch it together like a long sheath dress that fits nothing like it does the model in the image. It's cut to stretch so your body makes the curves instead of the dress giving you the curves with proper stitching. This is a cheap and poorly made dress. The weird part is that the seams are sitting where they should, but the fit is all wrong. It's as if the manufacturer tried to make the dress fit with as little material as possible. Rather than make a comfortable flattering dress for as many body types as possible they chose to cut corners and make people feel bad about themselves. Not a good business model. Read more",

        "body": "This is a very nice dress, especially for the price! I am a 12/14 and tried a few sizes, and ended up with the XXL. I did not want it too tight, and I wanted some give. I actually could have gotten away with a Xl or even L, but rather have the ease; rather than making my stomach poke out, the princess-ines are flattering. I said \"fit as expected\", but that is by the measurements they post with the sizes - this is NOT American sizing. Often when they use this sizing, I find the waist is too ow; that is NOT the case in this dress. I am 5'4\" and the length comes to my ankles. Glad I did not have to hem it but for a taller person you probably are looking at a tea-length dress. I actually bought it as a lounge-dress to be comfy at night, but I would not hesitate to put on a nice necklace an have a date-night! The purple is very dark, but some would call it elegant. The stretchy material is what makes it so comfortable. I cannot figure out why the \"Runched\" is in the title. When I first saw this title I passed it by, but then eventually I looked closely at the picture and did not see any raunching. Bottom line - if you wnt raunching you will not want this dress. The stretchy velvet has a nice, tight nap. again - WELL WORTH the money! Read more",

The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: XS, S, M, L, XL.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Wine Red, Purple, Lyons Blue, Royal Blue, Black, Green. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
