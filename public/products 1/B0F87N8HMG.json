These colors are not see though (someone mentioned the white is-can't comment on that). The material has a good winter weight to it. The dress is soft and warm. One reviewer said it comes wrinkled. Yes, just a little, but I iron steamed on the lowest setting as recommended on the tag, with a mesh cloth on top and the wrinkles came right out without affecting the pleats at all.

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve Maxi V Neck is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",

Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory.
