The flared sleeves are super cute and I love the sparkles on the black dress; they are multi-color iridescent and they don’t fall off. The only flaw I see with this dress was that the off-the-shoulder material kept rising up, even with little movement and I had to keep adjusting it down over my shoulder. I would try to get it sewn down for the next time I want to wear this dress. No regrets on the purchase. For reference, I am about 160lbs and 5’4”. I got a large. I wanted a little room for eating. It was great to wear a dress that wasn’t super tight but still draped my body nicely. Read more",

        "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars It's OK, with some caveats",
        "body": "I'm 5'3 and 185lbs and ordered an XL. The dress was long on me but I wore 2-3 inch heels and the length was almost perfect. I still found myself holding it up a bit as I was walking but thankfully it wasn't unbearable. If you're a shorter girly I'd recommend with caution. Be prepared to wear higher heels or get it hemmed. Taller girlies might find it to be too short depending on your fit preference. What i liked: 1. The color was just as expected. The sparkly brown was very subtle against my skin and felt very \"soft glam\" 2. The sleeves were very flattering and not too tight. The small bell at the end was also very feminine. The overall fit was also very nice, a bit stretchy so it moves nicely when walking, sitting/ standing, dancing, etc. 3. It's a decent price. More than what I would normally pay for clothing but I think for a gown is a respectable price (at time of purchase this item was priced at $64 ish) The obvious issues: 1. The sleeves roll up. I ended up using four safety pins around the front and back to help keep it in place but it wasn't a perfect system. I still had to adjust throughout the night but i would imagine if I didn't have the pins it would've been very annoying. 2. The stitching was a bit messy in places. Again thankfully not the worst but the stitching on the inside of the dress near the seams was a little bulky in some places which made it a little uncomfortable. Additionally, the top layer of fabric was a little itchy around my chest, it wasn't unbearable, but just something I noticed during the night. 3. I found glitter all over my carpet the next morning so obviously a lot came off the dress. It seemed to not be attached to the dress very well so that felt a little cheap when I saw how much was on the floor Overall it's OK. I'd recommend if you're looking for a pretty gown for not too much money, just be mindful of the length sleeves rolling up Read more",

It works ok if you’re up to 5’5” with heels or taller with flats. Stretches nicely but it doesn’t adhere to your body like a Lycra, because it has the lining and a veil-mesh over it . However, it’s not for a black tie event bc it’s a typical fast fashion dress with hems that show the stitches, and totally synthetic cheap fabric. It’s however very good for young people, low key proms, even low key weddings and photo shoots. Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
