Not sure how it would be on a shorter person but it hits right at my ankles. It washed super easy (I did hang it to dry so not sure about how it does in the dryer). I love that it has pockets and the color is absolute beautiful. Super natural and nice (I got the light blue with the black trim.) Because it is flowy, I can easily nurse by pulling my arm out of the strap! Read more",

        "body": "This dress!!!!! I was concerned I was going to look frumpy in this dress since there is not much actual shape to it. Boy was I wrong. The linen material makes it look so upscale, you can adjust the straps to make it perfect for you. The toe in the back does not do much, but it gives you a little something extra for such a simple dress. The pockets are nice and deep. I can honestly say I do not have a single negative thing to say about this dress. I get so many compliments every time I wear it, and it’s probably the most comfortable piece of clothing I own. The straps are thin so a strapless bra is ideal, but I’m not into those torture devices. Luckily the linen material is thick enough and the dress does not hug your body in anyway I am able just to wear the silicone nipple covers. And no one is the wiser to what I have on underneath. This dress is my favorite purchase of 2025, so much so I bought other colors. I have worn flip flops with them, tennis shoes with a jean jacket, ballet flats with lots of jewelry to dress it up. The dress is pretty much great for any occasion. You’re crazy if you do not buy the dress. I am 5’2” and 122 pounds and bought a size small. Read more",
