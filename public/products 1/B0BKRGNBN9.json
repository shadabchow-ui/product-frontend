        "body": "I wore this dress to a Filipina debut party and got so many compliments! I wanted something that looked classy but still had that subtle glam, and this dress delivered. The satin fabric is beautiful and looks more expensive in person. It flowed really nicely and had a soft shine that looked great in photos. The ruching is super flattering, it hugged in the right places without feeling tight, and the lapel with the button-down design gave it a more elevated vibe than a basic satin dress. I felt super confident wearing it. I went with the navy color and paired it with some simple heels and gold jewelry, and the whole look came together effortlessly. The dress does run a bit long if you're on the shorter side (I'm around 5'2\"), so it looked more like a maxi on me, which I didn’t mind at all, it made it feel even more formal. The slit on the side added a nice touch too, not too high, just right for moving and dancing comfortably. Honestly, it’s one of those dresses you can rewear to other events like weddings or special dinners. It’s comfortable, elegant, and makes you feel put-together without trying too hard. I’m already eyeing another color! Read more",

Panty lines, cellulite, rolls, etc. You'll likely need a slip, or at least a bodyshaper and no show panties.

I wouldn't recommend wearing this dress in cooler climates, it is good quality but it's nice and breezy and actually cools you off. There isn't much stretch but this dress is meant to fit loose to gather in all the right places. I sized up and it really was perfect. Like I said, it's a light functional dress. You can dance the night away. It is not lined but the material is completely opaque and very wearable. My stance doesn't do this dress any favors in the picture.

        "body": "5’5”, 165 pounds, long waist, shorter legs - Long read but worth your time - I am normally a large, but sized up in this dress. I first ordered the dress in the berry color in a large. First, I was disappointed with how muted the berry color was, and secondly, it was a little more fitted than what is shown on the model. And the loose fit on the model is what I was going for. Also, the button at my waist (the fullest part of me) had a small opening. The belt covered it up, but this made me feel like it was too small. So, I re-ordered in the x-large (and in green) and it fit more like what is shown on the model. As for the quality of the dress, it is a VERY thin material (the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5), and it will show every dimple and crevasse back there. Lol. I wore some “no show” underwear with this dress and you could even see outline of those. However this will not keep me from wearing it again. The belt is a great piece to cover the tummy if you’re self-conscious about it. It did such a good job at making me feel so put together and confident that I didn’t even wear tummy control underwear. This dress ended up being perfect for the occasion! I truly felt like a million bucks and felt so put together once I was done up for the event. I’ve included pictures of the berry dress in large and the green XL straight out of the package, and included pictures of the winning dress at my event. Read more",
