        "body": "I absolutely loved the Short Infinity Bridesmaid Dress! I wore it as a maternity dress to my baby shower and received so many compliments. The convertible wrap style made it incredibly comfortable for my growing belly, and I could adjust it to fit perfectly. The fabric was soft, stretchy, and flowed beautifully — I felt both elegant and at ease all day. The dress material was thick and was not see-through. The color was as shown. Plus, the fact that I can style it so many different ways means I’ll be able to wear it again for other occasions, not just maternity events. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a versatile, flattering, and stylish dress that's affordable! Read more",

        "body": "Overall the dress was great. The color was perfect, length and size all good except i have to take away a star for two reasons. 1. The tube top that comes with it does not fit, its very tight and rolls down, granted I am at the higher end of the sizing at a 12 but there is no way I could comfortably wear it at a 38D and fuller tummy. 2. It doesn't come with ANY WRAP instructions. You have to find videos online or go to their website and pay 5$. Seems like for the price that should be included or as least a couple suggested wrap options. Read more",

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars This is the Second “72 Styles Dress” I Have Purchased in a Month!",
        "body": "The “72 Styles Infinity Dress” in a beautiful Teal (greenish blue) color arrived promptly and was better than described online. I chose this knee length dress to wear to an upcoming party. It would make a beautiful bridesmaid’s dress as well. I knew from the start that this dress would be a winner. Just three weeks earlier I had chosen a full length “72 Styles Infinity Dress” in Blush Pink color to wear as a bridesmaid in a wedding. Four other bridesmaids wore the identical dress in the same color. Yet everyone looked beautiful and unique as they created their own personal style of bodice type with an infinity of different styles to choose from (please see photos.) I have designed and sewn custom Bridal Gowns and formal dresses for many years. The truth today is that quality fabric by the yard is very expensive. If on a budget, then this high quality \"72 Styles Infinity Dress\" is a 5*+ winner. It has many exceptional features at a very affordable price. PROS: * High Quality Materials and Construction - The exquisite soft hand and hefty richness of the \"Teal” fabric was immediately impressive. I also noticed that the dress was amazingly wrinkle free right out of the bag and box. Within 24 hours of hanging in a humid bathroom area, it was entirely wrinkle free. * Unbelievably comfortable to wear in any style that you choose! * Excellent attention to detail - all seams are encased, neatly sewn to accommodate 4-way stretching, and there are no loose threads. This dress can be hemmed if desired. * The soft and satiny fabric has an eye-catching, subtle sheen to it, adding to its beauty and attractiveness. Fabric is made of 92% Polyester for strength and 8% Spandex for elasticity. * The really unique advantage of this amazing, patented gown is that you have 72+ bodice styles to choose from. Go online to You Tube at home or in the library and check out the videos that offer tutorials on bodice-tying variations. You are only limited by your imagination. When practicing, it's helpful to have a buddy behind you to help you with draping and tying. I practiced alone in front of a full-length mirror with a hand-held mirror assisting me in viewing the back. Bringing all the bridesmaids dresses to your Bachelorette party and experimenting is even more fun. * Everybody has a different shape and size, and being able to customize a dress to your own flattering style and preferences is a real asset. Different bodice designs bring a lovely variety to the wedding party.... or you can all wear the same style bodice and wear that unique dress in different complementary colors. * There are 30 gorgeous, elegant colors and unlimited styles from which to choose and/or invent yourself. * Style-wise, the two gently pleated, slightly overlapping bodice pieces that rise up from the waist are a generous 12\" in width and 78\" (6-1/2') in length. That gives you an amazing amount of fabric to drape, twist, wrap and tie in unlimited ways around your neck, waist and upper body. If you don't require that much fabric in bodice ties, develop your own \"haute couture.\" You can neatly cut some fabric off to fashion hair ties, weaves, bows, small drawstring bags and more to complement your outfit. * This is a \"one-size fits all\" dress, recommended for US sizes 0-16. I wear a size 16, as I am big-boned, 5'8\", 38B and 155 lbs. The dress fits me perfectly. I am probably near the upper limit as far as elasticized waist, length and bandeau fit go. * The included tube top/bandeau (for added modesty) that arrived with my 0-16 dress measures 12' x 14\" and may offer little support for oversized girls. Consider purchasing a complementary bandeau with more support. * This Eye Candy formal dress can be worn repeatedly to different events by varying the bodice style. If you need a long dress for one occasion and then tire of it, you can shorten the longer dress to knee or cocktail length for a different occasion. The cut-off fabric could make a beautiful matching cape or bolero jacket. * One Size Plus is available for women who wear US 18-24. Once again, large-chested women may want to purchase their own sturdy, coordinating bandeau that offers more support and coverage than the skinny tube top offered for free with the dress. * An ideal dress for pregnant women, the stretchy fabric drapes and flows well and follows the contour of the body. Just place the elastic waistband over your baby bump. After delivery, the dress still fits. It is especially useful if you are nursing. No need to buy additional maternity wear for a formal occasion. * The gorgeous Teal fabric is True to Color. The fabric is stretchy and is non-see-through on me. Of course, fabric stretch increases the degree of see-through. If so, a half-slip can be worn underneath for more coverage if desired. * The dress hangs, drapes and flows with movement beautifully. * Ideal dress for many occasions as it takes up little space when neatly folded - a \"travel\" gown that resists wrinkles, prom, wedding, evening out, party, maternity, cruise-wear, award recognition night and more. *Recommended hand wash only in cold water for this non-shrink fabric. CONS: * NO INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED! You Tube videos and other online info to the rescue! ... Or use your own wonderful imagination! SUMMARY: Fashionable, inexpensive, cool and comfortable, easy care, adjusts perfectly to weight changes, limitless style possibilities.... all in one beautiful dress. As you read the many reviews, think about the $45 you are spending. This is not a $150 to $200 dress. If that's in your budget, then look elsewhere. For $43 this is an incredibly good-looking and good value for the money! Enjoy! Highly Recommended. Read more",
