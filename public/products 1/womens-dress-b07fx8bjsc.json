        "body": "Might snag easy; with the extremely rough skin on my fingers, they were like velcro to the sweater. Just something to be aware of. The all white appeared well made, no missed lines, shadowy stains, pulls or off colored yarns. Just a nice bright, white white! The white/green/black had odd grayish shadowy stains along the top back part of the white section. I'm glad I looked it over closely. The item I received was in a repaired bag; makes me think it was a return for that very reason. It really had lovely deep pigmented colors so I'll reorder it and hope this time I get a clean, new, perfect item and not someone else's return. The cardigans I have in this same yarn are also deeply pigmented, soft, cozy and I absolutely love them so I hoped the sweaters would be similar. They are but not quite as soft (this may change with washing, so rating this a 3), a little lighter weight and slightly more loosely woven. Not a bad thing necessarily but another something to keep in mind. Not stretchy at the neck so put it on before you do your hair and makeup. Read more",

With wfh being my new normal forever, I wanted a few inexpensive sweaters that would look decent in zoom calls while staying warm. This fabric was so thin, you could see through it. Maybe Ok for a lightweight fall piece, but not for winter. Fell on body like a thin tunic, not a chunky, cozy sweater. And JESUS the smell. I worked in apparel development for TEN YEARS, so I’m no stranger to products having some kind of smell when you open them, but this was unbearable. Amazon clearly is investing a lot in their fashion division, but it is just not paying off IMO, and you simply can not trust any of the (clearly paid) articles listing “best sweaters.” I want to be more thoughtful, sustainable, and local in my purchases- and this was a good motivation and reminder to stay true to that goal and not be tempted by low prices or cherry-picked reviews.

  "short_description": "Womens Dress is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.",
