The colour is a soft beige/ cream and enhances the details beautifully. The skirt is very stretchy and bump friendly. It has a fake string so you cant adjust the waist.

I got a size Large, color apricot and it wasn’t sheer at all, the quality of the skirt was fantastic, and it fit perfect and was so comfy! I am 5’5 and the length was perfect as well with it being pulled up to my waist. With all that said I am only giving it a 3/5 stars because it is definitely a cheaper piece of clothing. The back was adjustable and that was nice but the straps on the back were super thin and not the most flattering. The bottom was also an awkward length so I ended up just tucking it under itself. The ties on the skirt didn’t actually do anything and were not very cute. But these are all minor details and would not stop me from recommending it to people! Read more",
