        "body": "I've wanted a Dale of Norway sweater for years and years, and finally took the plunge since this one was on sale. Yes, they are expensive, but the craftsmanship is second to none. As soon as you hold the product in your hands, you know you have something special - and that's exactly how you feel when you wear it. The fit is flattering, and I feel like a million bucks when I'm wearing it. The wool is super soft, warm, and breathable enough so that you can wear it indoors without sweating, which is a big deal when you're my age. It's not scratchy like some wool sweaters can be, so you'd be fine with just wearing a camisole underneath. The only trouble is . . .now I want another one. I'm addicted! Read more",

Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.",
