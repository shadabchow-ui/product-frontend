        "body": "I ordered this last minute to wear to my boyfriend’s families wedding which was an outdoor wedding. It was extremely hot and humid, the dress was super lightweight which was really nice. The material is almost swimsuit like, so sweat stains will show. If you’re a bigger girl like me and you don’t like your belly lines showing, you may not want this dress. It can cling to you slightly, just enough that you could see the outline of stomach. It wasn’t too noticeable though. I ordered an XXL (I wear XL/XXL typically) to air on the side of caution, and I’d say it fit pretty well. Length might be short on slightly taller folks, I’m about 5’6 and it hit perfectly at my ankles. Color was as expected. Overall given the fact that it was a last minute purchase, I would recommend.

        "body": "Amazon messed up the last item I ordered and this was my last ditch effort to get something fitting the attire for an event I am attending tomorrow. The item arrives quickly, I will say that the material feels nice although a bit thin and transparent it can still work. I ordered this dress for the slit length on the side this is one of the inaccuracies with the actual dress and the picture. The actual dress the slit is much lower and it appears to have a place to extend the slit if you cut the seem however this only seems to extend it roughly 2\" (which still does not bring it close to what the picture shows) and there is a horizontal stitch that keeps the seem from continuously rising. So I am unsure of how to get past this without destroying the esthetic of the dress and if I do, what keeps it from extending on its own throughout my event. I am not a seamstress, which is why I ordered what I wanted from Amazon as opposed to making it myself. The other portion is a similar issue at the top where most pictures/reviews show you need to cut the seem to obtain the look reflected in the picture. What I don't understand is why this isn't already done. If you don't want it cut then your option is to safety pin it? Sounds a bit tacky and unnecessary since a dress was purchased based off the way the picture looked. *personally I needed something very quick due to the previous delivery of the wrong next day item I didn't have time to look at anything beyond pictures and overall ratings in order to have it here same day... I URGE YOU TO TAKE THE TIME! Last, a lot of reviews are naming receiving used items. My dress had one of the sleeves inside out as if someone didn't put it right side in after trying it on. I think a lot of people are disappointed with this purchase and return just as quickly as they receive it. Fortunately the condition of mine wasn't ad bad as others. I am out of time and having a hard time deciding on returning or just moving forward with this and attempting the altering myself (no time for finding anyone to make alterations) really bummed that the money I paid for the item I thought I was receiving was a waste. Buyer beware! Read more",

It doesnt do anything for me/my body. It has a scrunch in the back that helps tighten around the waist. I don’t have much of a “shape” so this dress doesn’t do much for my body. It is pretty full coverage and modest. Just not what I was going for. I feel like I look like a pilgrim, a stylish one at least. If this was the look i was going for, the dress would be perfect. Great length, very comfortable, stretchy, and cute. Fabric is thin though. Doesn’t feel cheap but not luxurious either. It wasn’t see through on me but it it was tighter it might be a little see through. The slit didn’t feel like it was high enough, it was an awkward placement for me. A small fit me perfectly.

        "body": "Oh my goodness, girls! I have been looking for a dress for 6 months or so to my nieces wedding. I am 5'5 and weigh about 145 lb. I bought a large and this dress came in and saved my life. I put it on and it fit me like a glove, has a cute slit, covers my shoulders, I'm not going to snip the deep v that it could have because I'm not that comfortable with my breasts but here's some pictures. I don't have my shoes on that I'm going to wear but it's also the perfect length. I have to wear flats because of arthritis and it's not even skimming the floor... At 5'5 it's a perfect length for me. I highly recommend this dress if you have a fancy event to go to. Read more",

I feel like my privacy was compromised even though it’s just a dress, what if I had ordered something else? Please go back to the regular Amazon bags!! The fit is good though I was hoping it would have been a little longer. The print quality… I thought it would be of a thicker fabric. This material is quite thin and almost reminds me of a dress from a cheap brand. I am a little disappointed with this purchase. Read more",
