Although I think that I probably could have used it underneath this dress because that's certain angles I feel like it wasn't super flattering to my midsection but I also feel like I could have pulled my midsection in more. But overall I was a great dress for the price I ordered two dresses and ended up keeping this one and returning the other one. The material for this company is not super thick but it's not super thin either. It's not see through but I feel like it definitely could have been a little bit more stretch to the material of a more softness it's not necessarily rough but it's just not buttery either. But for the price the quality and the material it served its purpose. It was a fun dress to spin around in at the end of the night. Read more",
