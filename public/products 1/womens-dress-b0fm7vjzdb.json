        "body": "This sweater is an actual real sweater. I love it. It's thick and warm and too cute! The quality is outstanding. The Santa hat is a good quality too. It looks and feels like it's supposed to. As for fit, I listened to all the feedback reviews and I ordered XL instead of 2XL, and could've went down another size if I wanted to go be form fitting. But, sweaters aren't supposed to hug you anyways. So, yes size down for sure, and depending on your shape, you can go down 2 sizes and still look great in it. I'm heavy up top (and everywhere else lol) so it's important to remember that if you're large on top, the sweater will look a couple inches shorter than you expect so just remember to allow for your curves and you'll get a great fit. As for the image on the sweater, let me tell you it's knitted into the sweater and not imposed onto the sweater. It's just an all around high quality item. Be sure to wash it before you wear it and it's perfect. I hope this review helps y'all decide to get it if you need that extra assurance, bc it's a good one. And btw, the terrific pockets and the spotted reindeer are why I won the ugly sweater contest in the originally category. Definitely go for it. Read more",

I only saw one other review mention this but there are thick pockets right at hip level that just add bulk. (The pockets are in the product photo but I think angles disguise them). I’m all for adding pockets to women’s clothes but make them functional and don’t have them ruin the line of the garment. This might look okay if you sized up (I’m normally a medium and bought a medium) it hit mid leg and I was planing to wear with tights and boots. I loved the alpaca design, I thought it was fun and a bit different. I’m returning and will have to find something else. Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: XS, S, M, L, XL.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Christmas Tree, Reindeer, Snowman, Alpaca.
