        "body": "I’m always on the lookout for casual dresses to wear to campus. This one is very comfortable and easy to put on. There’s no zipper, you just slip it over your head. Depending on the lighting, the fabric might seem to be a dustier shade of blue than it appears in the product photos, but I still think it looks nice. I would say the dress is true to size based on the measurements provided in the product listing. It’s very closely fitted to your waist though, so if you prefer to hide your midsection, this dress is probably not for you. However, there’s a ton of loose stitching and threads on the inside, especially around the waist. It looks really messy, and I just hope that it’s not going to unravel. There’s even loose threads on the outside as well. It’s a shame because while I do really like the dress, I feel like it should be better quality for the price ($36 at the time). Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.",
