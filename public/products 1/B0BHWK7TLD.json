        "body": "I loved this dress. I felt the sizing was accurate, I could’ve gone up a size but it was comfortable and stylish! (I’m normally a 16-18, and I ordered an XL.) No need to steam, most wrinkles fell right out. It is a true tie, and also has a button on the inside so it sits flush! Such a nice touch. The fabric was nice, thick, and sturdy! True to color. The cut was cute, because it’s true wrap the slit does come up high but other than a little wind blown situation which I fixed with fabric tape, it laid nicely and stayed put. All in all, I loved and would recommend. Read more",

        "body": "12/01/23 UPDATE: I loved the black so much I went back for the GREEN as well, again in a LARGE, but this time I got it way cheaper for Black Friday. Now I can't decide which color I like more, so I may keep both! I got this dress in the color BLACK in a size LARGE. For sizing reference, I'm usually a medium or large on top and am currently either a 36E/36F. In bottoms, I'm usually a medium-large or a 8-12/29-31 in pants/jeans, and if it helps, I wear a size 6 or 8 in Lulu leggings. I'm 5'3\" tall with a short torso, and my measurements are about 44\"-33\"-44\" (bust-waist-hip) right now, give or take. I've been on the hunt for a dress to wear to an upcoming work holiday party and this is the third one I've tried. I finally learned my lesson and stopped sizing up, and I'm so glad because this fits me absolutely perfectly and is TTS. This is a true wrap style dress, and on the first part of it, there are two buttons on the inside to pick from depending on how tight you want it. It'll only afford you about an extra inch on the waist, but I love that they did that. I have mine on the tightest one and again, perfection. I'm on the shorter side and the length was just right for heels - I have a little bit of extra material dragging (I took a pic standing normally so you can see about how much). The string to tie the outer portion of the wrap is nice and long, and I was actually able to wrap it all the way around to tie in the front if I wanted, so I'd say the sizing is super forgiving. Lots of cleavage, but I expect that in a wrap dress, and it makes them look really good. I'm not one to find a lot of clothes that I absolutely love on my body, but I feel really cute in this. The material on this is a really short velvet, so while it does have that weird texture per usual, it isn't bad at all. The inside is comfy. My husband isn't a fan of velvet but he didn't mind this. I love that is has a bit of a sheen to it, so it looks a little nicer than just a plain black material would. The weight is enough to feel a tad warmer without being too hot. I like in Texas in an area where it's warmer and humid all the way into January, so I wanted something that would sit somewhere in the middle. I tried mine on with a cute metal belt I had, just to emphasize the waist a bit, but I think I like it best without it... I haven't quite decided. Overall, this is a gorgeous dress that is really comfy but still flattering and nice enough to wear to a wedding, a party, or even something more casual. I'm definitely keeping this one and maybe even snagging other colors. Read more",

I got lots of compliments. Although it's short-sleeved, it's not something I'd recommend for a hot summer event. 70 degrees would be okay if you're not going to be moving all over the place but 80 degrees...better stay your butt inside. I'm 5'2\" and it was way too long but I just wore it with my highest heels and it was barely lifted from the sweeping the ground. (The length would be better for someone at least 5'6\".) I usually wear an XXL, mainly for my larger mid section, but I got this in an XL and it draped nicely for a flowy fit. (I could do a large for a more form-fitting look.) The tie is placed a bit too low for my height and the inside button to hide your cleavage is a bit high, but still a great dress. >>> 2nd order: I ordered another color to take advantage of a sale but it arrived with pet hair all over it. I was unable to try it on because I'm allergic. If you're going to resell a previously returned item, at least make sure it's in new condition! I had to return it. Read more",
