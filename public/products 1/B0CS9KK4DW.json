        "body": "i'm 5'8\", 32DD, natural, 25 inch waist, 37 inch hips. The dress fits really well- I love that it has a shape cut into the dress, so it's not smashing my body down. I love that it has more material built into the chest so you're not constantly pulling it up and down. I wish it had a shelf bra built into the dress to help support the chest. I wish it was an INCH longer in the front and TWO INCHES longer in the back. I will wear it with sneakers and a sports cap. I love the double mesh so it is light weight and casual. I wore it on a 95 degree, super high humidity day, and I felt cool and great. If there was an XS, I would order more colors. If it was an XS, then it would showcase my shape a little better. Right now, my body is doing all the \"work\" because the dress just skims over me. If it was smaller, then the dress wouldn't move around so much and maybe it would emphasize my curves more. I will likely roll an elastic into the hem of the dress to help keep it from sliding up. It's a pretty good dress. Worth 15 USA Read more",
