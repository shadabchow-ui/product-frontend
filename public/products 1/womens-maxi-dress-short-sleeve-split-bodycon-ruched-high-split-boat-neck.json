        "body": "The BEST, most flattering dress! I recently had a baby and the mom gut is really out of control right now. I had tried on so many dresses for a rehearsal dinner and NOTHING has worked, until this dress. It is made so nicely, hugs all the right places, and the material is actually so thick. It is probably not the best dress for a summery event because the material is thick and heavy (in a good way). The little tie in the front with the drapery is perfect for hiding the not so pretty parts of my belly and the sleeves are perfect! It is very comfortable as well. The slit is very high but because the neckline is so elegant it’s not too high that it looks trashy. I LOVE this dress!!! My bra size is a 34DD currently and I bought a medium. Fits great!

I ordered one size bigger for a more fabric/wiggle room and I’m so glad I did- Not that the dress runs small but it is a fitted fit. Going up a size allowed me to adjust the fit a lot better- i do recommended sizing up if you’re in between sizes, like myself, as you can adjust the fit with the drawstrings in the back. Found it to be so flattering and I’m not an hourglass or apple bottom babe lol also flattering for both my itty bitty titty gals and our buxom babes. The drape in the front doesn’t accentuate the tummy much at all, I found that it concealed nicely. The slit in the front is high, but the dress did not open a whole lot - still be weary of wind and things like that. Read more",

I have a small band/large bust which is an issue with clothing (5'6\", 26 waist, 32H bra size), and the size S worked great. At my height it was the perfect just-above-floor length with flat shoes. It lays beautifully on the body and the slit comes up high but actually is magically placed so that it reveals just enough and doesn't need constant readjusting. Corset back ensures it fits like a glove!! If you found this dress because you wanted the d00p of the real one... I'm so glad I payed this price instead, I don't think I would have noticed the difference in quality. I've never liked an Amazon dress so much and I've never said this in a review (I'm really picky!) but I will be buying this in another color. Read more",
