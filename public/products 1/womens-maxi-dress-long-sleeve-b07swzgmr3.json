I Absolutely loved this dress- it was the perfect YES to the dress and what would be our beginning of relocating our wedding and changing the date, venue, and State in a matter of a weeks notice for some of our guests to ensure our family who wouldn’t had been able to attend could! I gladly canceled my original gown for this one - not just because it was saving me nine times less ( not even a joke!) but because it was perfect for the occasion. I am 5’4- about 175(hips& butt) Got the dress in two days Ordered a size 16- fit a little big in my breast area- but it’s most likely due to stress and losing weight there first- The length was perfect had I been able to wear a nice heal- but I had a beach wedding and even still it was a good fit resting on the sand. Color was Ivory- which was beautiful in photos !!! The back of the dress laces up! So ladies be ready for so sucking in !!!! It holds you in and push’s you up in the right direction!!! Had I planned a little more appropriately- I would had pulled the inner layer out more and maybe even cut some of the fabric so it laid a little shorter- just so it didn’t bunch up so much- over all - had I known what I know now- regardless of changing and rebudgeing the whole event, this still would’ve been my favorite dress and Yes dress ! Highly recommend this dress! Seems to be a great choice for a ton of us brides ! ❤️ Read more",

This one was available in my size, would arrive the day before the wedding, and had good reviews, so I took a leap of faith and ordered it. To my surprise, it was the perfect length, the measurements on the size chart were accurate, the color didn't wash me out, and the sleeves were big enough for my large arms. It was very comfortable, and the corset was able to be tight without being so tight that I couldn't breathe. It was thick enough too, that it wasn't see-through. I got SO MANY COMPLIMENTS on this dress! My now husband (who hadn't seen my other dress) said he liked this one better than the custom made one, which he saw for the first time after the wedding. Everyone talked about how beautiful the dress was and they couldn't believe that it was from Amazon! I couldn't recommend this dress more! I could've gone one size down, but after having one dress that didn't fit, I went with the size Amazon recommended based on other orders. Also, for reference, I'm 5'11\", and weigh about 180 lbs.

        "body": "The dress was lovely but it did not fit in the shoulders or the back and would have been too much of an alteration project. But the reason for ONE-STAR is that I had so much trouble from the Chinese dress company in trying to return it. They refused to send me a pre-paid return label like promised on the Amazon listing, and tried to offer me 30-percent back if I would keep the dress, which I could not use and was not an option for me. Once I got Amazon involved, they finally sent the pre-paid return label. However, it's been six weeks and I still don't have a refund. They now claim they have not yet received the dress back, even though the mailing label was sent to a U.S address. Just checked my USPS tracking number and it said the pre-paid label by the seller did not have proper postage, so the package is in limbo. What a shady dealer!!! Checking back with Amazon now for recourse. Read more",

The fit on the top is flattering and secure, while the skirt flows beautifully with every step. The veil completed the look perfectly, making it even more graceful.

The lace sleeves didn’t lay naturally on my arms, and the lace on the bust was a bit too thick, it didn’t form or drape as easily as I’d hoped. I know this is a budget-friendly dress, but still it didn’t quite deliver enough for me. It runs true to size, though the bust is a bit roomier just a heads up that you’ll need to wear a bra with it. There’s also not much volume in the skirt, which may be totally fine depending on your style, but something to keep in mind. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: XS, S, M, L, XL.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Off-white. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
