It’s one of those easy, go-to pieces you can dress up with heels or keep casual with sandals. There is not a lot of stretch in the fabric and the fabric is soft without feeling like it is going to be ruined after a few washes.

        "body": "I wore this to a church function and I received many compliments! This is the perfect summer dress for that type of occasion. The dress is not too form fitting and it still gives you a feminine shape. It is simple & casual, but also elegant & classy. You can dress it up or down! I wore it with nude open toe sandals and I think it looked nice. You could also pair it easily with cute sneakers or your favorite Converse! ( I bought the dress in blue denim too & paired it with my maroon Converse and it was a super cute combo! ) I did order this dress in a large originally, but it was a bit too big & frumpy looking. I returned for a medium, which fits much better. The material is fairly lightweight and suited for summer. I believe the material was thick enough, offering good coverage and it was not see through. I did wear a slip but I don't think it's necessary. Read more",

        "body": "I am 5'8 and weighed around 180lb when I got this dress (I ordered a large) I am now around 200lb (pregnant). It still fits! The tie in the front is cute. The material is breathable and good quality. I love the pockets! My only complaint would be that there is some gapping in the buttons so that could be a problem for larger chested women. I am normally a 34 C and don't think it would gap for my normal cup size however being pregnant has me in larger cup size so more gapping. I think this could be an easy fix though. I do feel like the dress is a little shorter then advertised but being pregnant would affect that as well. It has made a great maternity dress and I plan to use it when I am breast feeding as well.

  "short_description": "Womens Dress is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Navy, Bright Pink, Off-white Confetti Print, Green Vine Print, Black Camel Animal Print, White Yellow Petal Print, Black, Blue White French Stripe. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
