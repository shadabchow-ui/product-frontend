        "body": "This dress was everything I needed for my glamorous Christmas photos with my babies. I purchased 5 dresses because it’s really hard for me to purchase dresses lurch less online. I’m not a dress girl. Let’s make that real clear. I am a T-shirt and leggings/jeans type of girl, so I was really worried that none of them would be flattering or comfortable enough. I won’t lie, I loved every single dress that I ordered off Amazon. The quality was great, but we’re here to talk about this one. The one that I chose at the end of the day. It’s very stretchy and comfortable. The slit up the side is just sexy enough to keep you from showing off too much But still make you look like one hot mama. I wore a body shaper that’s basically like underwear that goes all the way up to the bottom of your bra because I didn’t want it to show through this fabric. It is thick and made really well but I knew that if I got anything like a corset style or anything super thick it would show through the dress for sure. some of you may not need that extra Shapeware but after two kids this mom needed just a little smoothing as it kind of shows all curves. Anyway, as far as length, it was almost too long, even with 6 inch heels and I am around 5’7”-5’8”ish without the heels. That’s one thing I loved about it because long dresses are usually too short on me. I also got these beautiful sparkly rhinestone heels off Amazon and they went beautifully with this dress. At the end of the day I highly recommend this dress as it’s really great quality, has a great stretch, really comfortable and so damn sexy! Read more",

I wore very high heals so the length was good but if you're wearing low shoes you may need to have it hemmed I got a lot of compliments on this dress. The slit wasn't too high so no wardrobe malfunctions. Definitely wear seamless panties or none at all. It does hug the body and will show seems. Overall I loved it!! Read more",

The large fit me comfortably, but it was too big in some areas like the breast (the top part flopped over) and the crotch area (Too baggy). The medium fits me like a glove! I Love, Love, LOVE this dress it is amazing! I received several compliments from men and women all night long! Lol. I got hit on, flirted with, etc. I am Not Single! Lol This dress is most definitely a head Turner! I was on the fence about purchasing, but it is the perfect little black dress to add to your closet! Okay, here are the deets, I'm 5 7\" 194lbs, I usually wear a large, but in this case I'm glad I purchased the medium! The material does stretch but not too much, just enough to hug them curves! Lol. The arms weren't restricting and I didn't feel confined all night! I did wear a girdle just because of the curvature. If you're on the fence, I'd order. I'm glad I did!
