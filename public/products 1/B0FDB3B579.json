        "body": "The fabric is very lightweight to the point that it shows whatever undergarments one is wearing. As it is a sweater material, it clings to every curve, which can be great if the person wearing it is in phenomenal shape and wants to reveal all of those features. I usually wear between a large and an extra large as I'm tall and pear shaped. I ordered a large for this dress, and I think I needed a medium for the upper half (the chest area) and an extra large for the bottom. In other words, the large did not fit well at all. The chest was loose. The skirt was too form fitting. I wanted to love this dress, but it is not flattering for my shape at all. I imagine that it would look great on someone with an hour glass or even a straight figure, but it is sadly, not an ideal choice for a pear. Read more",

The last thing I need is my bra making a surprise appearance. The fabric is thin and lightweight—soft and a little warm—but overall the quality didn’t match the price. Cute idea, just not worth the accidental peep show. Read more",

        "body": "It's much thinner than it looks in the picture, but I still wouldn't say it's bad quality. It's also shorter than expected, and I'm only 4'11\"! I was thinking this would be a nice winter dress, but it wouldn't be as warm as I initially expected. It's more of a fall or spring dress. It runs small for sure. I got a size up because that was all that was available at the time, but if I had gotten my size it probably wouldn't have fit well. It's fairly form-fitting, although not unflattering. Still, if you're looking for something that's a little looser, maybe size up even two sizes. It is also very low-cut. I liked the wrap design for nursing, but instead of being modest when needed, it's immodest all the time. You could see my bra. If you're smaller busted and/or don't wear a full-coverage bra, it probably wouldn't be as obvious, but this is not appropriate for church or library storytime. Although it doesn't seem to fit the picture on the model, I don't think the price is crazy. It's a decent dress for what it is. Read more",

The dress felt much like a shower curtain rather than a dress. It is quite large for its size as well, and although it does come with a sash for the waist line, it looks a little frumpy. Unfortunately, it is also a little see through as well, so I wasn’t comfortable wearing it out and about. Overall, it’s not the worst dress in the world but it fell short of meeting expectations.

        "body": "I love when items come in these zippy bags. I always appreciate good packaging (plus they’re useful afterwards). The color is as pictured. It’s mostly polyester with a little bit of spandex. This fabric feels like polyester so keep that in mind if you don’t like the feel of that type of fabric. It is a little bit see through over the entirety of the dress. It’s hand wash and hang dry. For something that takes extra care, it doesn’t “feel expensive”. It’s a casual dress. I live in a warmer climate so this will work for me for fall and much of winter but if you are in a chillier climate, this may be a bit thin to wear during that part of the year. When I saw the pictures I thought it was a wrap dress so I didn’t mind getting a large as I thought it would adjust a bit, it’s not and it doesn’t. I would not suggest ordering up. Order your normal size. Read more",
