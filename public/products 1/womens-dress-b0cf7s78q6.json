        "body": "This is my 2nd Barefoot Dreams wrap, and I am so glad I got it. I wanted one to keep at my office since the AC is always so low. It's perfect for keeping this Florida girl comfortable in 68 degrees. I love the elegant drape that smoothes out my silhouette without seeming bulky, and the way that the fabric is so light and soft yet just warm enough. The pewter color is a bit darker than expected but will go well with gray, blue, black and even most browns. And the pockets are functional, perfectly placed for hands and angled in such a way that a phone or keys won't slip out. I like the angle on them too, creates a smoother line. Just perfect!

        "body": "I am 5'3 and can fluctuate between 155 and 165 pounds (a little larger when I ordered this the first time). I had the grey color in the past in the M/L size and it fit fine. I truly enjoy the Barefoot Dreams brand. This \"beach throw\" is truly a multi-purpose cardigan, sweater, wrap, etc. It has become like my \"security blanket\" of sorts! And, y'all, it has pockets (hallelujah chorus)! Not only would I buy it again, but I did! I lost mine, & when I looked and looked & still couldn't find it, I ordered another one. However, I live on an island and ride my bicycle around quite a bit. The length got in my way so I began wearing it with bottom (longer part) just tied in a knot on both sides. I ended up wearing it for several years. Recently, I ordered a S/M in the (nautical blue color) because I did want it to be a bit smaller. I love it. I do really love this fit better - but remember I am shooort! It is perfect for travel or when in the summer heat, we have the air conditioning turned up in stores offices and businesses. It perfect for an evening walk on the beach. Buy one - be careful though - it will spoil you! Read more",

I’m 5’6 135 lb and ordered the small/medium and it’s perfect. I usually freeze in airports but this thing keeps nice and cozy. It’s perfect for traveling because the front has enough material to wrap around you like a blanket. My sister in law had one, and after trying it on once, I had to get one. Price is worth it. I haven’t washed mine, but my sister in laws has held up nicely over the years. I got it in the taupe and the color is true to the picture and very pretty. Read more",

The softness of these products is amazing. Warm and the right weight. I live in Holland now and love to put my robe on when home but feel like I don’t want to wear night clothing during the day so the wrap, sweater type clothing items are great! I am allergic to wool and this is perfect! My robe is a blush color and my sweater wrap is gray. Love both. My new robe and sweater replaced my old robe that looked like a couch blanket. Read more",

This style has little bit longer frame, and arms, the drape adds style, making this cardigan different. I just treated myself to a black one, then got another in lighter color. This gray/pewter-y colour is lovely, but will be returning for the taupe. Because I have wanted and never had tannish cardigan. Perfect weight, warm…not too warm. Weighty enough to look as.luxurious as it feels. Highly recommend BF items, this cardigan in particular. It will elevate daily leggings/tennies, or a dtess/heels. Works beautifully for us lankier people. BONUS…I have NOT had pilling issues. Which is a major problem with most soft sweaters. TREAT YOURSELF👍🏼 Read more",
