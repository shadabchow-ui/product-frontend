        "body": "I was nervous this was a dupe/stolen picture, but took a chance and am so glad! Thick material (sweater jacket vs just a sweater) which is perfect in my old cold house. shallow front pockets fit my fists, not objects. A bit shorter than I'd prefer, make my torso look short/wide frumpy - but doesn't really take away from the fact this is gorgeous! Not itchy at all which I expect from wool jackets I've purchased from elsewhere. The apricot color is lovely since a lot of \"khaki/beige\" colors look terrible. This faint apricot color is exactly as expected. Excited to explore other products from Aran! Read more",

Extremely well made; many of the pieces are knit in. Very soft. Sizing was perfect. It's quite a bargain for the price and I am considering buying more for Christmas presents. Can't wait for our Michigan winter weather. Read more",

        "body": "This sweater is beautiful. I already have the coatigan version which I adore so I wanted it in a cardigan length also. I ordered an xl because I could have ordered it in large if I wanted the fit seen in the online photos but prefer sweaters to be on the looser side (my coatigan is an xl so I knew that the fit would be what I was looking for) for layering purposes and bc I do not like snug or fitted clothing (post-menopausal). All Aran sweaters annd garments are well-made and warm and this cardigan is no exception. My husband and I have Aran sweaters, scarves, and knit hats and the quality is top notch. The army green of this cardigan is a perfect wool color that has varying, subtle shades of green that you’d have to get close to to see. Heavy duty zipper. My sweater shipped directly from Ireland and arrived quickly. Highly recommend. Read more",

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Just exquisite!",
        "body": "This is a gorgeous sweater, beautifully made, quality wool, nicely stitched, and is a unique and eye catching design!! Best of all… it is SO warm! My husband purchased it as a surprise from my wish list, I had it marked a size large to accommodate wearing layers underneath. The fit is perfect, not too baggy if lighter items are worn and not squeezing if heavier layers are put on. It arrived while my Mother-in-law was visiting, and she fell in love, so she is getting one for Christmas, which is testimony to it’s warmth, since she lives near Buffalo, NY! I was hesitant to purchase the sweater for myself, although I was so drawn to the color and design, simply because I hate spending that much money on myself. But, after receiving it as a surprise, I can say, I would unflinchingly recommend this sweater, because the quality far exceeds the price! I am fairly certain that this sweater will remain as a constant in my closet for years to come! FYI, the shoulders fit just outside of my arms, the chest is very roomy, waist doesn’t hug and make hips look large, sleeves are a perfect working length, and although the fit is more relaxed, it does not look boxy or frumpy!! Great for casual work around the house, perfect for outdoors, and could certainly be dressed up with jeans and cute boots!! Read more",

        "body": "I've received so many compliments on this wonderful Irish sweater!! And by women who knit!! Love the color, the style is chic, the neck can be zipped up all the way for a kind of mock turtleneck, or unzipped 1/3 and the collar folds open. Perfect for spring as it is warm enough for cool and unpredictable days if you wear long sleeves under it. Wear short sleeved shirts for some cooling when the sun comes out. The air does get through the knit. Has a great weight to it, not light, but just right amount to me. Can't tell you a time I went out wearing it that someone hasn't asked me about it. Read more",

        "body": "It is an excellent piece. It is super warm and gets compliments everywhere I go. This is the second of these sweaters that I have purchased. I definitely recommend it, however, if you are a smaller framed lady, I would recommend going down to the x-small. I am 5'3\" (160 cm) and currently 128 lbs (58kg). I bought this sweater in a size small 3 years ago. The original sweater has held up great, but after I lost a little covid weight, it just became a little too big and frumpy for my frame. This is exaggerated by the fact that there is a double layer over the front where the zipper is, and it has pockets. This will make sure you are extra toasty, but also has the disadvantage of becoming a little boxy . I switched to an x small and it fits great, with plenty of room underneath to fit a thin knit layering sweater/thermal. I will donate my original to my sister who is a bit bigger than me. If you are 5'5\" or below and weigh below 135, you may wish to consider the x-small if you like the trimmer fit. Read more",
