        "body": "I LOVE this dress! I've tried other brands who offer a similar smocked bodice and they're all too long in the torso or too tight. This dress is perfect! No punching or puckering. It is so comfortable and the fabric is beautiful! Also the quality of construction is high. I'm 5ft 3in with a 40in bust/36DD, 29 in waist, usually a Med, size 10 top and a 4 or 6 bottom. I got the large and it fits well. I based my size on the waist measurement and hem length not the bust. Sleeves aren't too long and the hem hits right above my ankles which is my preference. Also the pockets are well placed and do not add bulk to your hips. This is perfect for the office, an interview or the board room with a blazer, a wedding or shower, for church or an after 5 event. It's a must have for your closet. So versatile. My only drawback is there is NO lining and the background of the material is semi-sheer. Because it is see through, you must wear a half slip. Everything shows. The smocked bodice is not see through. Even so I'm giving it 5 stars for all that is right with the dress! Get yours today! Read more",

        "body": "This is truly an adorable dress. The fabric is quality (I'm a seamstress, so I always look for that). It also does not have any rayon in it, so shrinkage and wrinkles will be next to none. The fabric actually has a bit of texture to it, so the print pattern has a bit of raised texture which enhances the whole look. I'm 5'6\", 135 lbs., and the small fit me perfectly. If I had one complaint, I'd say the sleeves could be a inch or two longer for mid-to tall gals like me. Overall length hit me mid-calf. Perfect dress for fall/winter, and the caramel color looks AMAZING with a darker jean vest or jacket. Read more",

        "body": "The Fall Midi dress is designed for comfort and style. I ordered it in three colors for this fall season. The colors are true to the pictures and the dress is exactly as described. I appreciate that there was no change in the quality between the colors which sometimes happens. I am 5'--162lbs and ordered a L which fits well. It almost falls at my ankles but I expected that and actually prefer that length. The sleeves come to the wrist plus the neckline maintains its modest coverage. The material is lightweight and very flowy, it moves beautifully with me as I walk. The material is not see through and the flower motif is outlined by stitching giving the dress texture and interest. It is comfortable to wear and easily pairs with a sweater or jean jacket. I am glad I got additional colors and am thinking to pick up a few in colors for Spring. True quality control makes this an outstanding dress. It is priced well and I wouldn't hesitate to order more and to recommend this style and seller. They have earned their 5 stars. Read more",

I hung it up but noticed a lot of wrinkles from the packaging, so I just steamed them out and it looked amazing. I would never iron this dress, even on the wrong side, because it would compromise the fabric and the fray areas around the flowers. Take the time to use a steamer. Read more",
