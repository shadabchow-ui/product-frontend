        "body": "My fiancé liked this better than I did. The fabric is thick and the color is vivid, decent quality for the type of dress. I had a dark color so no worries about it being see-through. Stretchy and slightly big on my waist so I might have been able to size down but it wasn’t noticeable enough to make it worth the effort of return/replace. I wanted to layer it with a jacket for an outdoor fall event and I don’t think that worked for my personal style but it is cute on its own for something indoor or slightly warmer. Overall comfy for wearing through a long day. Read more",

        "body": "Purchased this dress initially to wear for my nieces' high school graduation day/events. LOOOOOVE!!! I will looking to purchase more next Spring/Summer season. The weight is great...not too heavy, but feels weighty enough for you not to feel like you're wearing a fast fashion piece. The length, stretch, color, and fit were all great. I'd definitely recommend this dress. It does wrinkle pretty easily - I'd say using a steamer would be your best bet because the bottom gets tricky. I am a size 14, 36DD, 5'10 with my proportions pretty well balanced and I purchased a size Large and it fit perfectly. Read more",

The quality of the dress is good but the wrinkle lines from when it was folded, packed, and shipped will not come out. I washed the dress hoping to get the wrinkles out of it, but they were still there. I even ironed the dress while it was damp to see if the steam would get the wrinkles out and still wrinkled. I am going to take it to the dry cleaners to see if they can get the wrinkles lines out of it. If not, then it was a waste of time and money. Read more",

The sleeveless arms, round neckline and the flowy skirt hem make it look sophisticated. and the knit design around the waist hides the tummy perfectly. The material is soft and feels light. Light enough for hot weather. But not light that it feels cheap. I would say maybe medium weight then. For reference, I'm 5'3, weigh 112 lbs , 60yo and work out regularly. Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.",
