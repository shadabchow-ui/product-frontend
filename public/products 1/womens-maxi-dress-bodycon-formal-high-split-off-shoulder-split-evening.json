        "body": "I wore this dress to a formal wedding and let me tell you, I was in love with it! I received so many compliments. I ordered it on a whim the day before the wedding (I didn’t really love what I had already chosen to wear), and received it early morning of the day of the wedding. I really had no expectations that it would work out given the last minute decision to order it. But it fit and looked great! (I did add a little detail myself - a black bow to the side of the dress that has the slit, so don’t be deceived into thinking that comes on the dress). The dress is the perfect length for me, fits amazingly, is so comfortable to move around and dance in, and the material is very durable. It has stretch and is a comfortable thickness without being heavy. The next time I have to go to a formal event or gala, I’m ordering it again in a different color- that’s how much I love it! Not to mention, it’s only $50…c’mon! Can’t beat that value! (For reference, I’m 5’2” and about 130 lbs and I ordered a size small). Read more",

There weren’t any loose threads or unraveling ones which many others at this price point have had. However, the color is a much brighter purple than the dark one on the image.

It was modest, stretchy material, perfect for dancing in, and the fold over parts of the \"off the shoulder\"&neck/back area lay beautifully without any constant adjustment needed. The color was dark navy blue and was absolutely gorgeous -it fit her like a glove which we was hesitant and leery about the fit of this dress before ordering. It was awesome material and not uncomfortable or scratchy against her skin. The dress was not sheer, so she was able to wear any undergarments with this dress.

        "body": "I purchased this dress for my girlfriend for a formal event, and it was a resounding success. She felt absolutely radiant in it, and the compliments she received throughout the evening were a testament to its impact. What We Loved: Elegant Design: The off-shoulder neckline and high split added a touch of sophistication and allure, making her feel confident and glamorous. Flattering Fit: The ruched detailing along the sides beautifully accentuated her curves, providing a slimming effect that she adored. Comfortable Wear: Despite its form-fitting nature, the fabric was stretchy and comfortable, allowing her to move and dance with ease. Versatile Style: Perfect for a variety of formal occasions, from weddings to galas, this dress proved to be a versatile addition to her wardrobe. Minor Consideration: Sizing Nuance: While the dress fit well overall, the sizing can be a bit tricky. She found that the medium size was slightly roomy in certain areas, leading to occasional adjustments for a perfect fit. It's advisable to consult the size chart carefully and consider sizing down if between sizes. Final Thoughts: This dress made for a memorable gift, enhancing her natural beauty and boosting her confidence. It's a stunning choice for anyone seeking a blend of elegance and modern flair. Just be mindful of the sizing to ensure the best fit. Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Bodycon Formal High Split Off Shoulder Split Evening is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Red, Winered, Navy, Pink, White, Darkpurple, Peacock Blue, Royalblue, Rose, Black, Green. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
