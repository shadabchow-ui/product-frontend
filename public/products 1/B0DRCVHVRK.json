        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Summer Work Dress!",
        "body": "With these NYC heatwaves, I was on the hunt for something lightweight but still polished enough for the office—and this PRETTYGARDEN dress delivered all that and more. The material is breathable and comfortable, making it ideal for commuting and sitting through meetings without breaking a sweat. What I love most is the versatility. The gold buttons elevate the look, adding a touch of elegance that makes it easy to dress up with heels and a blazer. But it’s just as cute with flats for a more casual day or even a stroll through the park after work. The fit is structured and flattering, with just enough stretch to move comfortably throughout the day. It’s well made, available in multiple colors (yes, I’ve got my eye on a second one!), and with a pair of tights and a cardigan, I can definitely see myself transitioning this into the fall. Highly recommend for anyone looking to stay cool, stylish, and professional this summer! Read more",

The pleats on the back are very flattering, and the zipper is also hidden into a pleat, making the dress very seamless and elegant. Great value for the money, and have no regrets. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Sleeveless Formal is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress Sleeveless Formal is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Red, Brown, Khaki, Pink, Blue, Dark Khaki, Grey Blue, Apricot, Army Green, Black, Peach Pink, Green. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
