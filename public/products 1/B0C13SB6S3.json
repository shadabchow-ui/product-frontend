        "body": "Loved this dress and got tons of compliments! Easy to wear, sparkly, looked like pictures, fit very nicely/flattering, but sequins did irritate my arms from rubbing. I am 5’6, 155, and wear 34DDD bra, and did not wear a bra. Even a strapless bra tended to peak up in the back, so wore nipple covers and tightened straps. Straps are adjustable and stayed where I adjusted them, which was great. There are some built-in, smallish round, thick pads in the bra area that caused slightly abnormal breast shape but not very noticeable. Would have been better without them but they are in between layers of fabric and not visible, so I felt that cutting them out would have been risky. Read more",

I was also concerned it would look like a costume or be too flashy for the formal wedding I ordered it for. This dress did not disappoint. I felt elegant, the sequined pattern is tasteful without being flashy. I received so many compliments! It is lined and comfortable. There isn't a built in bra, but I felt secure and covered. I didn't have any issue with the sequins scratching my arms as other reviewers have pointed out. It felt just as well made as any other dress I would get at the mall. I actually got stuck on a sharp spot on my chair (chair defect, not a reflection of the dress) and the dress did not snag or tear. I made it through the whole night without a wardrobe malfunction. I am 5'1\", 115lbs and ordered a small. It fit well, but was a bit long for me- the length just skimmed the floor. I actually cannot wait to have an excuse to wear it again. Read more",
