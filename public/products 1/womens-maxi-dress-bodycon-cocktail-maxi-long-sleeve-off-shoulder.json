My sister was wearing a heavy shrug with her dress, but this sweater dress was warm enough that I did not need it. I took these photos after wearing it for hours, so it had begun to sag a little bit because of the knit fabric. So the photos really do not do this dress full justice. But it was so flattering to my hourglass figure! It was just the right length for me (@ 5'4\"), and it was very soft and comfortable. The knit fabric is very thick. It was thick enough that I could wear no bra under it without worrying about looking risqué. But it is tight enough to be flattering. For reference, I bought a Medium; and I am 5'4\", 140 lbs.
