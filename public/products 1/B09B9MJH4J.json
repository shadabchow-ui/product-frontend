Easy to put on, fabric is light but not thin-feeling, great for Winter/Spring/Fall, those in between seasons, although you can add layers for the cold or get some breath from the sheer sleeves. The large was comfortable although I probably could’ve worn a medium. So very true to size. Nice A-line cut so I had room in the hips, but also structure on the top with the seams. I felt a bit like Princess Peach, in a very good way! Would highly recommend! Read more",

Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
