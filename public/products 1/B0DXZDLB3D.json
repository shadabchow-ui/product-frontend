        "body": "This dress was adorable this summer. I grabbed it in two colors—the white and the pink—and both just pop against a tan like they were made for vacation photos or a cute night out. The fabric is honestly soft as silky butter (if butter ever decided to become a dress). Sizing-wise, I’m 125 lbs, usually wear size 4 pants, and I’m a 36D. I ordered a medium, and it fit perfectly—especially in the chest area. It is a form-fitting dress, so size appropriately depending on how snug you want it. The ruffle hem and ruched waist make it feel like a boutique find, not an Amazon impulse buy. I got so many compliments, and people couldn’t believe it wasn’t from an actual boutique. Lightweight, double-layered, comfy, and surprisingly chic. If you want something soft, flattering, and effortless, this is an easy yes. I may or may not be debating a third color… don’t judge me.

        "body": "This is a great dress. It is very forgiving in that it flares out where a lot of women want to hide their stomach and it is fitted in the general smallest part of the waist. The ruching on the side seam adds additional forgiveness. The neckline is elegant and the added layer at the bottom makes it look fancier than it would otherwise (it is a full layer that goes to the waist, not sewed to the hem). The material is very much like that of a swimsuit cover-up, so it has a bit of a sheen to it (which even though it is cheaper than cotton, it looks more expensive than cotton). This also means it won't fade and pill like cotton. The length is modest without being frumpy. Read more",
