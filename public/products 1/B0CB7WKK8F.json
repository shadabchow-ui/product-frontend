        "body": "I purchased this last minute for a comedy show and I’m so glad I did. I loved it. It was stretchy and hugged my curves in all the right places. The dress looks a little transparent but the brown color keeps it from being too see through. I put on dark black undies in order to ensure it wasn’t so transparent. I ended up taking the rhinestone buttons off because I felt like it didn’t match since they were silver and I was wearing gold accessories. They were very easy to just cut off with scissors. Careful not to cut the dress in the process. I ordered a size medium. I’m a 34 D, 158 lbs and 5’2. My hip size is 44. I can normally wear a small or medium depending on the cut and fabric. I went with a medium to give me a little more wiggle room and ensure the length would not be too short. The medium was perfect. The color is a chocolate brown and does not vary much from the outline photo. The straps that come across the front are a little adjustable. I loved the quality, fit, and price for this little number. 10/10 recommend! Read more",

Disliked the length - SO short (I’m barely 5’7”) I can’t walk in it without my butt hanging out. The rhinestone beads on the front are super cheap and tacky in person.

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve Ruched Bodycon is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
