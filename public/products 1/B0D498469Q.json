        "body": "I wore this ABYOVRT backless mini dress for my college graduation, and it was absolutely perfect! I’m on the skinnier side, so I had it tailored to fit my waist and be snatched, and it looked amazing.

The open-back design adds a sexy touch, while the overall style remains elegant and classy, making it perfect for graduation. I felt confident, stylish, and feminine, and received so many compliments. If you want a dress that’s sexy, classy, comfortable, and flattering, this is definitely the one! 🎓✨🤍 Read more",
