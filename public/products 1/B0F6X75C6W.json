        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Most flattering dress I’ve bought in a LONG time ❤️",
        "body": "The media could not be loaded. I’m 5’3” and around 160-170, 38DD and I carry most of my weight in my midsection. I usually wear either a Med or Large, but went with a Med in black, based on reviews and photos. It was an almost perfect fit. Purchased it for a dinner with a Hollywood/Red Carpet theme, but didn’t want to spend a ton and wanted something I could wear again (since I don’t have many events to dress up for). This was the first and only purchase I made and it was perfection. I bought a glitter belt to wear on the waist to add more glam for the night and paired it with fancy jewelry. The only thing I wish I had added was maybe an oversized flower near the shoulder for added drama. So many people complimented me and I felt so chic and glamorous. This reminded me of something Kate Middleton would wear, and she was my inspiration for the look I wanted. It was formal but not over the top, it was INCREDIBLY flattering and the fit was just right. Purchasing the dark green next because I loved this dress so so much. It was comfortable (I helped run the event and was in it for hours, even after the dinner was over) and I felt so beautiful in it! (Including a video I originally sent to my friend when doing a trial run before the dinner….be kind, as it was just meant for her to see! 😂🫣) Read more",

Chiffon is very light on top so the edges of the bra show through….weird slit in front of the left leg which looks like it’s a rip not a slit which totally takes away from the look of the dress. And was so unnecessary. It came delivered folded up in a small bag so will need to have it sent to the dry cleaner to press. The pink is not the pink shown at all it is a dusty rosy beige color.
