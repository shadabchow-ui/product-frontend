        "body": "So, so comfortable. I'm someone who loves extra big t's or birthday suit. This is the next best thing except I look like I'm ready for a night out, instead of a bum, while being extremely comfortable. For me, this a little short for a dress but it's represented accurately in the picture. I'm not that bold anymore so I wore it with pants. The fabric is thin, but not see through, stretchy, soft and breathable. I've slept in this thing a few times also. I need more in other colors! Want to mention that the shape of it is perfect for hiding a little extra tummy. Very flattering so if you wear this to a buffet you won't have to suck it in.

        "body": "I tried the Floerns Women’s Deep V Neck Twisted Plunging dress, and…eh. It looked sexy on the photos, but IRL? It felt like a thin costume you’d pick up for laughs. What tanked it: Material felt cheap—thin, flimsy polyester with zero substance; several reviewers said it “felt thin and not worth the price” or even smelled funny Poor construction—loose stitching, uneven seams; really not what you expect when it retails for significantly more. Price vs quality mismatch—this thing should’ve been around $10, max. Spending more just feels like a rip-off considering how it wears . What could have worked (if it wasn’t terrible): The cut is flattering if it actually held shape—a deep V and twist front could highlight curves nicely. Lots of stretch (95 % polyester, 5 % elastane) Could’ve made it comfy…if not for the total junk feeling. Bottom line: Sorry, Floerns, but this was a big nope. The vibe’s there—a flirty silhouette with a sexy slit—but it’s all ruined by cheap fabric and sloppy sewing. Not worth more than $10 in the bargain bin. I returned mine—it deserved a better home…or no home at all. Read more",
