        "body": "The dress really is beautiful quality. It has a long train. I wore a petticoat under to lift out the skirt a little so i wouldn't trip and to show off the beautiful embroidery. For a dress in only going to wear twice in my life this was a wonderful selection. The seller emailed me after i bought it to ask for custom measurements. I opted not to use them and sewed my own adjustments. I sewed up the front a little so there was not much cleavage, sewed the sleeves so they would stay open around my arms and added ribbons to tie across my back. Stitching on the dress is secure. The embroidery is light. It isn't super thick and moves with the dress. It adds a rustic look. My dress was true to color. I ordered ivory and it was an off white. I would argue it was a little light for ivory but it didn't look stark white. The side panels are a mesh that is a dark ivory almost light brown. If that bothers you, take it to a seamstress to fix it. The panels are see though and that didn't bother me. I don't know why the review says the wrong weight. I am 260lbs. Read more",
