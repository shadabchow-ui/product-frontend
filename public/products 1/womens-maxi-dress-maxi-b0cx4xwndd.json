        "body": "This is the cutest little overall dress!! I saw it (as I am sure you are now if you are a jumper/overall lady like me and your eyes are popping right out of their sockets at the moment of how cute this is). Size I am about 145lbs-150lbs 5’4 34C curvy athletic body I went with a Medium and it fits perfectly. The dress style is loose and comfortable (long A-Line type of dress). That said, I do buy clothes often in size large if it looks like the item might run smaller. This dress does not run small it is right on the money. If I got it in large I would be swimming in it and if I went with a small for a more fitted look well It would take away the forgiving comfort aspect of the overall look and feel. I was trying to figure out what color to get but I gravitated towards the “white” color even though the apricot looks very boho/mountain/old fashioned country style (I like that too!) but I choose white and I am very satisfied. As far as “see through” don’t wear black underwear and you should be fine, if you are worried about it you can double up on a slip and put a short slip on under the one that is build into the dress. I find the material to be very breathable, comfortable, and lightweight in a good way (not in a cheep way) Bottom line if you see this and your heart skips a beat like OH MY GOODNESS that is cute, and you have the right body shape for this style and or you have a piece of clothing that you are able to slightly compare this to that has worked for you in the past, I would say take a leap of faith and try it out. Enjoy! And hope to see one of you wonderful ladies out there wearing this so we can be overall dress twins! PEACE <3 Read more",

The cut is meant to be loose and flowing… and it truly does. I did get a medium… I am 5’4 and 130 pounds. A small would have been better, but this is truly comfortable and the fit is supposed to be loose, so I keeps it. If you are looking for a shabby chic or a dupe for Free People … you found it!

        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty but too wide for me",
        "body": "Came June 28th 2025 it comes nicely folded, and a plastic bag inside of a box. It doesn’t have any kind of weird smells so that’s a plus right away. It wasn’t super wrinkly. Also good it looks beautiful. The color definitely looks true to the color on the Internet, even though the description is red it is like a burnt orange dark salmon color. I’m 5 9 1/2 and Im 130 pounds fit. I do go up and down between 119 to 130 I’m a 38B/C right on the edge but I do have that 38 wide back that us tall girls have. The length is probably like an inch and a half to my ankles. I understand the look is that it’s supposed to be kind of baggy but on me I think it makes me look really fat. I’ve tried adjusting it and moving it around, but the wideness isn’t flattering. But if I pinch the fabric on the left and the right of the rib cages and I just fold it over 1 inch. It fits so much more beautifully so I think that since I wouldn’t wear it like this all baggy and saggy and making me look 20 pounds heavier I’m going to return it and try the extra small. However, the measurements on the extra small would make the bust too tight for me so I’ll let you know if it actually works out or if it meets accurately with the size chart. It’s very breathable. The fabric is soft and smooth on the bottom and then the top piece is more of a canvas type stiffer material. The overall straps do come undone. If you want them to be you can put them on and off that way, they’re also is a liner to the dress. I thought this was gonna be a lot more casual and that I would wear it in the yard but the bottom of the dress could very easily snag on a rosebush or tall grass and get a run in it or a rip so it’s funny because the top is very casual outdoors farmer type but the bottom is more like sitting at a restaurant or going to a wedding and not being very active. So it isn’t something that I would feel comfortable wearing in my garden cutting flowers and herbs and unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons that I bought it. The other reason is that I’m going to a farm fundraiser party and it’s a little on the dressy side so I thought OK. We’ve got the overall top. We’ve got the fancy bottom this is gonna work out. I think I would give less details to you girls if it wasn’t so expensive I think it’s overpriced. If it was $20 I’d say OK that’s the perfect price for it. They don’t need a lot of detail it is what it is for $20. They’re just gonna keep it and not return it anyway but for 40 people need to know exactly what they’re getting into.. Read more",

        "body": "Love! Love! Love! I had been eyeing this gorgeous bib dress for a while and finally bit the bullet and placed an order. I am so glad I did! This dress fulfills that Boho Chic look that I love. The skirt is sheer with monotone flowers embroidered on it and a built-in slip that comes short above the knees. The bodice (bib) is made up of denim with embroidered flowers and cute adjustable embroidered straps. The entire dress is trimmed with a beautiful, feminine lace. The only critique I have for this dress is that I wish it had side pockets. That would push the rating to a 10! For reference, I am 5'1\" and typically wear a size L. After reading reviews, I decided to order this in a size M. And the fit is better than expected. I'm going to order another like this but in pink and MAYBE a size S. That's how much room this dress allows. At the very least, order a size down from your normal size. If you're brave, order 2 sizes down. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Maxi is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Maxi is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: XS, S, M, L, XL.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Red, Pink, White, Apricot, Black, Coffee. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
