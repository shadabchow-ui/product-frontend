        "body": "Ok, this is a long, somewhat in depth review for the dress and five different colors. We are renewing our vows for our 25th and I want something that isn't wedding dressy, something that I know I'll wear again. I'll provide size info and then my opinion on the dresses themselves. I didn't wear anything under the dresses because I didn't have to and I wanted to see what they'd look like without. And omg, you don't NEED anything under this dress because it will give you the shape of a goddess! Also, I only order with Prime because Amazon is just too much of a gamble to not have that free return guarantee. My stats are: 5'4\", roughly 132+/- depending on what I nom nom nom on, 34-25-35, size small/4, and my current bras are 36 DDD. They don't match my measurements but it is the bra size that fits me. Idk, my ladies are large-large and every piece of clothing that I own that covers them is stretch fabric so they fit! This is THE dress, gorgeous, versatile, and makes you look like you exercise more and eat less. So far I have ordered the beige, red, black, royal blue, and both wine colors. All colors were in a small, all had the same thick fabric and nothing showed through any of them. I did not have a gapping issue with the bust as some women have (but that's due to the girls' size). I didn't take pictures of all the dresses because I forgot to. The beige, red, and black all came in a plastic bag with a zipper that was clearly labeled with the sizes, the manufacturer, and the color, tissue paper wrapping the dresses, and a piece of foam wrapper around the top of the zippers so they wouldn't create an indent in the fabric. The royal blue and both wines were in a plastic bag that had to be torn or cut open, did not have any identifying stickers on the bag, and did not have any sort of protective tissue paper or anything over the zippers. None of the dresses had a book at the top and they do need one so plan on that super easy, super fast fix. Only the black dress had hanging ribbons sewn onto the dress, this was missing on all other dresses. I think it would make it somewhat difficult to hang the dress without those ribbons since the halter would stretch out and using a hanger with clips on the top will eventually create a permanent indent in the fabric. I guess they could be folded? But who does that with a dress? Anyway, moving on... The beige leaned towards pink. The red is an orange-red and not a true red or a red with blue undertones. The black is a true, deep black. The royal blue is a gorgeous, saturated blue that looked exactly as advertised. Although my pictures don't reflect it due to poor lighting and camera skills both wine colors are *exactly* the same shade and fabric content. The beige, red, black, and one of the wine colors all fit the same and as I expected a body con dress in a heavy stretch fabric should. The royal blue and one of the wine dresses were tighter, the royal blue to the point where I thought it might be an XS but there is no identifying size anywhere. I could get it on and zipped but it was noticably smaller. These are very much like tight wiggle dresses from the 50's in that you need to take very short, ladylike strides (which can be super sexy). All the dresses came to mid-calf on me and the short ruffle hem is a fantastic addition that gives the dress a lot of personality and flirtiness. I'm not sure what the difference is, but I question if all of these dresses were made by the same manufacturer due to the differences in packaging, the care taken with the packing, the way the dresses fit, and which dresses were consistent in size compared to those that weren't. Maybe it's just my snobby imagination but the dresses that were packed better all seem slightly superior. They were most definitely the most consistent of the seven I ordered. So far the black is winning. The red is just not the right color for my pale skin, there's something about the wine dresses that I'm not loving, the beige is all right but kind of expected, and I would be keeping the blue if it had been one of the better packed dresses that were consistent in size. I have time so I'm considering ordering another small to see if it's any different than the one sitting on my kitchen table waiting to be returned. I had ordered other bandages dresses from this company, and while they were also fantastic, this one gives the silhouette I'm looking for: classy while also being sexy, flirty, and ever so slightly suggestive because the shape this gives you in AH-MAH-ZINGGG!!! I don't think you can go wrong ordering any of the dresses from Meilun, some are just better than others. I order a lot on Amazon and these are easily some of the absolute best clothing items I've purchased! Read more",

        "body": "10/10 this dress will have you snatched to the GODS! I always check reviews looking for people with similar measurements and this was tough because I'm so short and was worried this would fall at a weird length on my frame. I'm 5'0 and 105lbs, small chest, and bought a size small in orange. Perfect fit! - XS would have been too tight. So happy with this purchase! Hugs your curves, or if you're like me, the ones you didn't even know you had! Super wrinkle resistant (I folded it and stuck it in my luggage, took it out for a wedding and didn't need to iron). Material is thick and durable and had the right amount of stretch - similar to bandage style dresses. Halter was great length, I wore a strapless bra (tried pasties but they made me look really flat chested, so a bra with some shape was a must) and I added double sided sticky tape and had no issues all night. I did not wear shapewear, so I'm not sure if that would show, but had no issues with lines showing wearing seamless undergarments. A little restrictive towards the bottom so, I mean, you're not going to shuffle, but you're also not going to be taking super long strides either. Honestly, I still wouldn't change a thing about construction on this dress. Great quality, comfort, price, and a piece I will wear again and again shamelessly. Would buy 1,000x over. Read more",
