        "body": "I’ll be honest- when I first opened my package I was not pleased with the color- because it was the first thing that stood out. it’s more of a neon salmon/orange color - then I tried it on and holy cow!! The way it hugged my curves had me smiling from ear to ear- super comfy, super sexy! The open back is to die for! It’s a stretchy material- tags show it’s 83% polyester and 11% elastane - the quality is good! I dig it! But man oh man what a dress! Perfect for elegant parties, cocktail parties, weddings, proms, a fancy anniversary dinner date, new years, shoot! The list goes on! Just buy it already. I’m still not a huge fan of the neon color but that’s a “me” problem lol however I did buy it in green and black- can’t wait to get them! Sent a photo out to the group chat to get them opinions and 10/10 of my besties gave heart eyes and fire emojis! Buy it! There is no disappointment here ladies! Sexy but classy - sheeeesh. I’m 5’2 and it’s a little long but it’s a perfect length when I have my heels on. The only thing that is lengthy is the sash but I think it’s meant to be like that. Might have to hold onto it when moving around. Overall it’s a beautiful dress. Read more",

        "body": "Y’all, this dress was SO beautiful on!!! It was made of thick, quality material that had a lot of stretch to it as well. The long strap allows for a lot of versatility in regard to being able to wear/style the dress in many different ways. The open, low plunging back line combined with the scrunched gathering around the derrière was definitely a head turner at the concert I attended! This was my first time ever purchasing a dress from Amazon, and let’s just say I was NOT disappointed. I wore 4in heels with this dress, and it still dragged the ground a little so be aware of that if you’re vertically challenged like myself. (For reference: I’m 5’1, around 155lbs, with a 34DDD bra size & I purchased a medium.) Overall, I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase this dress again in a different color! Read more",
