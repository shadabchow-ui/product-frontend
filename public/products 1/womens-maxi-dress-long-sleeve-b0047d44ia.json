        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Impressed!",
        "body": "I purchased this Midweight Minus33 XXL top and the matching Minus33 Mindweight XXL bottoms a while ago for to take on a week long elk hunting trip into the great alpine wilderness of Eastern Washington. I knew it was going to be COLD up there and I am not someone that easily stays warm in the elements. Cutting wind, snow, ice, frigid rain... you never know what is happening next. I decided to save my review until after I'd put these to the test. I was looking for 100% wool base layers in something my size and was very pleased to find these, not only in my size, but made for a woman. Bless you, Minus33!! I've spent a lot of very cold, miserable winters wearing other \"thermals\" that either didn't help at all or made me sweat so much becuase they did not breathe that I was uncomfortable and froze anyway. They seem to be well made, I found no flaws in the initial \"once over\" nor after I put them on and wore them. I had no issue with the elastic as one person had reviewed. They wore well and laundered nicely... even in a bucket of ice cold stream water, being poked with a stick and hung over the camp stove to dry... if you can call that laundering. Both the top and bottoms came in the mail quickly, and when I tried them on, I was very pleasantly surprised. It was SO nice to put these on and have them fit so well. I am long through the body and tall, and these fit like they were custom cut for me. Stretchy and cozy, I was immediately happy. The crew top was long enough in the hem to fit my long body nicely and the sleeve was long enough that the cuffs actually came down to my wrists. The bottoms were also cut nicely, long enough for my long legs, fit me VERY well all around, perfect through the butt and crotch, waist line high enough to not worry about \"cracking out\" when I bend over, which has always been the price of having to wear men's thermals (not to mention no \"front door\" to have to sew shut!). The material did feel just a little bit itchy when I first yanked them out of the package and tried them on, but that went away after a gentle wash and dry. I can honestly say that these Minus33 100% wool, midweight base layers made all the difference in the world this last season. NEVER before have I been actually WARM when out in the elements for any length of time. The 5 mile hike up into camp in a foot of snow would have rendered me a sweaty, wet, frozen mess before but this time I was comfortable and toasty, even when we stopped to rest and cooled down. I had packed polar fleece thermals with me just in case these weren't enough, but those never made it out of the pack. I was so toasty in these, I often just wore them by themselves with a down vest for hiking around in, carrying my heavy outer wear in a back pack to put on over them when I got to where I would be sitting. They really proved their worth in the wet, too. One morning I slipped, lost my footing, and fell into the creek and had to hike back to camp just wearing them, carrying my outerwear and my gear. My boots were soaked but I was also wearing 100% wool socks. I wasn't exactly warm along the way but I wasn't frozen by the time I got to camp. My Dad was an ice fisherman and he always, ALWAYS wore his wool and told me that there was nothing better, especially if you ended up wet. I wish I'd have listened to him years ago, I wouldn't have spent so many winters shivering. These came home in great shape after a week of crawling around in the elements being worn constantly as under wear and as only wear. I literally lived in these things and wouldn't hesitate to buy another set. Thank you, Minus33 for an absolutely outstanding product. Read more",

        "body": "We are hunters and we have a big vacation planned in the near future going to Yellowstone National Park in the Winter. I live in Louisiana where our cold is a wet cold. But in Montana it is a dry cold. After reading many informative documents on how to dress for the cold and the extreme cold in Montana, I knew I needed to purchase some clothing made from Merino Wool. Merino wool wicks perspiration away from the skin. I don't need my my husband getting out in the cold and getting wet only to get pneumonia! Keeping dry helps to avoid hypothermia in the winter. I ordered this top for myself in the Charcoal color in large. The fit is perfect. I will be using these as my base layer. This top is lightweight not bulky like I thought it would be. It is very soft and comfortable – not itchy at all. When I think of wool, I think of the heavy, thick, itchy, bulky material but not this 100% Merino Wool. The stitching is done perfectly. These have flat lock seams to prevent chafing. I washed mine as soon as I received them in cold water and tumbled in the dryer on low. I have tried them on and I am very pleased with them. These are made for women with the curve around the waist. I have not had the opportunity to wear these in the cold yet – still 100 degrees here in Louisiana but I have been wearing them in the house just to make sure they fit and are comfortable. They have passed that test and they are very warm but I can't wear them for long right now. I highly recommend this product. I paid full price for this item but a day after I purchased these, the price went up. Read more",

        "body": "I love this shirt - I got the size medium, which is the size I normally wear, and it fit perfectly. This is meant to be a base layer (undershirt) but can be worn on its own as well and still look good. The thickness is perfect so as not to be too hot but warm enough. I have worn this backpacking and pretty much every day during the winter this year. It looks flattering with just about anything and can be dressed up or down easily. The best part is feeling warm and cozy when everyone in cotton is freezing :D I liked the fact that when I wore it to sleep in while backpacking, even though I got hot during the night I never got clammy and was able to open the sleeping bag a bit and get comfortable. With cotton, I would have had to change shirts after sweating. The shirt dried right out and I felt comfortable, and it didn't even stink after multiple days of wearing it. It is totally worth the price! Read more",
