        "body": "The dress is super cute. I absolutely loved the flared sleeves. I ordered it for a fall wedding and got a lot of compliments on it. I'm 5'3\" and 225 pounds and typically wear a size XL sometimes 2X as I have a 42DDD/F chest and need extra room in tops. I hate wearing dresses as alot of them have a specific sewn in section for breasts and those typically are way to small for me despite the dress fitting everywhere else. After reading reviews and seeing the measurements I sized up two sizes (3x) in hopes it would work out. Alot of people in the reviews were talking about how the chest cage was \"laughably oversized\" but it just barely fit my girls. One thing that isn't shown or mentioned is the front where the tie is has a slit and the strings are used to close it. Having a large chest those often suck because it makes the chest look like when a women is wearing a button up too small and her chest is busting at the seems and you get peaks of everything here or there so I ended up having to safety pin it close so I didn't flash people. I'll probs end up sewing it shut later on. I didn't want to size up again because I knew the bottom half of the dress and sleeves would have been drowning me with fabric. People were saying the dress was cheap feeling and not worth the price but I honestly thought the fabric felt decent but I'm also not use to being able to find cute alternative things in my size for super cheap do maybe thats why I wasn't bothered by the price point. I'll definitely wear this at other events or even just during spring/summer at the flower festivals. Read more",

Some things to note: - Fit is TTS - It's short mini length and shows a lot of leg - There is a gap in the front bust where it ties and if you have a large chest that gap will be wide. I wore a thin black tank underneath so it just showed black and looked intentional. - Fabric is nice! It's thin almost chiffon fabric and the black pattern is a velvet texture. There is a liner so it isn't see through besides the sleeves Read more",

        "body": "Decent quality only complaints I have is the bust area is open in the middle it has about 1/2 inch gap so even if you \"close\" and tie the strings it still shows gonna need to figure out how to fix that. Also the thread used for stitching is super thin. I went to the a bow with the string and it snapped before even tying. Also heard a few \"snaps\" from the threading around the waist. Pretty bummed but I need the outfit for an event and can't find anything locally. I did size down from recommendation and it fits good. I am a 40DD and it was still a little loose. I will upload a picture once I get back home. I got black and it was a nice color nothing faded. I think this dress is overpriced. I wouldn't pay more than 15$ for this dress in all honesty. Super comfy no itchy fabric fit and flare fit. Super cute over all I would highly recommend for the smaller body sizes for the plus sizes just be mindful our bodies need better quality to be flattering and last. Read more",

I did choose to double knot the bow to not cause a public panic with strings coming undone. Very flattering & lightweight. I live in Florida and tend to get hot really easily.
