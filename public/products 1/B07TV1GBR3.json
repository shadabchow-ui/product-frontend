        "body": "This dress did it for me! I wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments! The dress is a thicker material not thin at all! Everything was in tact and overall the dress was well made. My only issue was the bust area as there is no real support there. I purchase my regular size (Large) but had to get the bust area altered because it was too big and didn’t hold me at all. I’m not very busty but the dress would slip down under my breast when bending down because of the lack of support build into the dress. A simple alteration to the straps (which are also not adjustable) and a good bra fixed this issue! The dress fit my bottom half perfectly! I am 5’3” 191lbs and a 36C bust for reference! I loved the color, definitely good quality! This dress will suck you in but I did wear an undergarment to smooth me out underneath. Just be aware that if you are gonna put a clincher with clasps in the front underneath, the rubbing will show. So an alternate shaper is recommended. I would order this dress again in other colors and endorse others to make the purchase as well! You won’t regret it! Read more",

It's hard to find things that fit my body type that aren't imported from England or something because nobody seems to accommodate big busts and hips with small waists. WELL. THIS DRESS IS PERFECT. Even if I weren't an hourglass, this dress would be flattering. The material is thick and stretchy, not see-through, and so comfortable. It fits me like a glove. If you have a different body shape than mine, the dress has things that would hold you in the rught places to be flattering! The bust size listed was much too small for me, but I went for it anyway, as the waist and hips matched. The tiddy cups are so stretchy and supportive that it doesn't matter! The straps are thick and comfortable, as is everything about this. It breathes well. The length is perfect. It's well made. It looks killer with a fancy blazer. I'm really excited to wear this to my birthday party and then for a long time afterwards! Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Bodycon is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress Bodycon is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Wine, Gold, Hotpink, Blue, Viridity, Ivygreen, Peacockgreen, Black, Lightpurple, Orange, Orangepink, Antique Pink, Olive, Red. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
