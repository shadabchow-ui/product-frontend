The color and style are as pictured, sizing is true to size and it has some stretch to it which makes it super comfortable. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the velvet nap is upside down so when you run your hand downwards it’s on the rough side and upwards is the soft side (although my friend who knows clothing construction said that’s because the color is more vibrant that way.

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Maxi V Neck Short Sleeve Formal is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Velvet 4#dark Pink, Velvet 4#navy Blue, Velvet 4#burnt Orange, Velvet 4#wine Red, Velvet Burnout 4#black Floral, Velvet 4#pinkish Purple, Velvet-Plus Size P-emerald Green, Velvet-Plus Size P-pumpkin Orange, Velvet 4#chocolate Brown, Velvet Burnout 4#burgundy Floral, Velvet 4#green, Velvet 4#blue Green, Velvet 4#emerald Green, Velvet Burnout-Plus Size P-black-2.
