It’s very forgiving and I appreciated that it could hide my recently postpartum tummy while also being breastfeeding friendly. I wore this for our family newborn photos and felt confident in this. The material has a nice feel and is flowy - definitely giving boho vibes. The color was not see through which I was concerned about but I did wear nude under garments just in case.
