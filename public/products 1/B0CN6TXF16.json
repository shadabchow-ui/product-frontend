        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars PERFECT Dress - Made my menopausal self feel pretty again! 😍",
        "body": "If you are going through perimenopause or are in menopause, then you will know how it goes: one day you are OK with your body, everything fits the way you want it to fit and then the next day even if you don't gain weight, everything moves to a different place - or like in my case - you not only gain an extra 20 pounds but you also have the weight moved to places that you do not appreciate! My weight seems to have accumulated in my stomach and thighs. I am not overweight, but I somehow have little \"rolls\" around my middle🤷‍♀️. Ladies in Peri and moving towards peri - IYKYK. This dress makes me feel pretty again. The weight of the material is excellent. It is not too thin and not too heavy. This dress has great flexibility because you can wear it with tall boots, heels, and even dressy flats. I also saw a few reviews with women wearing heeled booties. I liked it and I'm about to try it on with booties right now. It truly is a multifunctional dress. I bought it to wear to Valentine's dinner and a business event. I bought it in black thinking that it would hide my \"pooch\" a little easier than the red. But- now that I have the black and have seen the quality of the material and how it lays, I am already putting the red one in my cart😍😍😍. Valentine's Day weekend will be a little chilly, but I think I will be just fine because of the weight of the material and the long sleeves. The little flare on the end of the sleeves is what makes the dress so adorable for those of you with longer or shorter arms, I think mine are pretty average and length and the end of the sleep goes mid palm on my hand when I hold out my arms. I was also unsure what size to get because some people were getting a medium and they were my size and some were getting a large also close to my size. In the end, I went with a large due to my bust size and not liking to have dresses be tight under my armpits. That drives me crazy. The large fits perfectly. It is not too tight, but still hugs all the right places. I am 5'6, 150lb, 36DD, 30\" waist if this helps anyone. Read more",

It also doesn’t wrinkle easily, which is a big bonus for long nights of celebration.

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Bodycon Long Sleeve is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit.

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Bodycon Long Sleeve is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Red, Winered, Navy, White, Beige, Purple, Peacock Blue, Rose, Black, Orange, Green. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
