        "body": "AMAZING dress! Flattering! I ordered a Large (and an XL just in case) The LG fit perfectly. I am a 36DD or 36E in bra size (with broad shoulders) and the bust fit perfectly. I am carrying extra weight right now, all in my mid section, and this dress flowed perfectly over it. I wore it to an outdoor wedding. I got the Sky Blue. I did wear a tank under it - the ANRABESS Women's sleeveless scoop neck tank top ribbed fitted in khaki and it was the perfect match. The material is soft & flowy. Very comfortable. It came right out of the package without wrinkles and I did not have to iron it!!! My friend liked it so much she made me send her the link so she could order the same one. Read more",

        "body": "I really like this dress, it's not only beautiful, it feels good to wear too. I got the Dokotoo maxi dress in X-Large (Sky Blue 1) Boho Floral Print. - For reference, I’m 5'4\", about 182 lbs, with a 37\" waist and a pear-shaped figure. The fit was flattering, and fairly comfortable for what I like in a comfy dress. The fabric feels really nice and lightweight, perfect for warm weather, as I live in a very hot Southern state in the US. I love that the hem hits right at my ankles, exactly the length I like. The adjustable tie straps make it easy to get the fit just right, and the flowy ruffle hem adds a cute, boho touch. Overall, it's a great dress for summer, whether you're heading out or just want something easy and breezy to wear. I’d definitely consider getting it in another color! Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
