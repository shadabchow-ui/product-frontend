Anniversary coming up and I'm very excited to wear this. I carry all my extra weight in my mid-section. You fellow \"spare-tire\" girls know what I mean. Ugh. Too many dresses either accentuate that tummy or look too frumpy and unflattering. This little dress is magic. The inner lining has a little stretch that helps keep your gut in check. Not majorly, but enough. With the top layer floating on top, it's like that tummy disappears. The pattern of raised lines on the dress help with the camouflaging, too. I haven't felt this sexy in a while. Excited to wear this for my man. Also love that it can be dressed down with combat boots, low tops w/knee high socks, a cool jacket, etc. for more informal affairs. I'm still a punk rock girl at heart! *About the length - I'm 5'2 and this is presentably short at mid-thigh. If you're taller and concerned about the length, it may be too short to meet the grandparents, if you know what I mean. Good luck out there, ladies! Read more",
