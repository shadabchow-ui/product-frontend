        "body": "Dress fits amazing. I didnt follow the recommended size by Amazon would’ve definitely been too small. I did look at some picture reviews and saw someone that weighs the same as me and went off of that based on body shape and size. Bottom of dress is a little fitted , snug on the thighs, but the upper body is loose not tight at all . Also, I didn’t realize the entire back was mesh so I had to improvise and get some adhesive bra/boob tape so I can wear the outfit without the visual of a bra line. Overall outfit was amazing wore with some shoes from Shein . I am 5ft 3” in height. I weigh 183 pounds. size ordered was a size large. Hope this review helps. Read more",

        "body": "I love everything about this dress. It’s short, but stays put even with dancing and lots of movement. People mentioned that it is tight at the bottom, and I think that’s what keeps it from riding up. It was absolutely manageable and had room for my hips. I’m also heavier in my arms and usually nervous about dresses with sleeves not fitting them, but the mesh has tons of stretch. The material held tight to the smaller areas of my frame and stretched where it needed to. I danced hard and nothing broke or unraveled. I love the see through back of this dress, and used some tape on the sides of my chest to make sure everything stayed put without having to wear a bra. I’ll probably repurchase this in another color. I’m 5’4 and 170lbs. Usually wear medium tops, XL bottoms, generally size 10 in dresses, or medium/ large dresses. The size medium of this dress fit me perfectly. Read more",

It reminded me a lot of the mid-2010s HC dresses we had (my Bachelorette party was a throwback party) so i thought this would be perfect.... the skirt wasn't bad, sizing was accurate. But the top just didnt work. The black squares on the top were very thin, not a dress you can wear a bra with obviously, but definitely cant go without one for it being so thin. The material cuts abruptly at the sides and creates a weird line down the side. I think very specific body types can pull this off? But it definitely wasnt for me Read more",

And just like other reviews said, the very bottom seam is pretty snug around the thighs but manageable. There really isn’t any stretch to the skirt. The dress stays in place while walking and if you’ve ever been to Vegas, you do a TON of walking. The top is perfect, and I didn’t need to worry about any surprise exposures as the top stayed in place. 100% recommend this dress! Read more",

Then, when I went out with friends, I dumped wine all over the front of my dress, down my legs and into my boots. And the dress still looked great. I was able to go clean myself up (mostly my legs). The dress was still wet from the wine, but you couldn't see it at all. I was able to wrap-up my night with minimal embarrassment and hassle and am SO happy I was wearing this dress. Thank you!

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",
