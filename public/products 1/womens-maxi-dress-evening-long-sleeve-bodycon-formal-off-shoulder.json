        "body": "First of all, I was impressed with the high quality fabric. It's the perfect weight and has a nice stretch. This dress is unbelievable for the cost!!! I ordered this and am Xscape dress to try for an upcoming ball. The Xscape dress was crazy flattering and won hands down. HOWEVER, i'm not returning this gown because it also looked great! Plus, it's an insane bargain! I think the top looked best pulled down on both shoulders. i loved the mermaid look at the bottom of the dress. This dress would pack easy and would be perfect for a formal night on a cruise, etc. I kept it because you never know when you might need a formal gown and I couldn't justify returning this beautiful bargain gown. Also, it's very form fitting, but is the kind of dress that I know I'll still be able to wear when I lose weight because the fabric is stretchy and allows you to bunch it up to create a nice illusion to flatter your tummy. If I wouldn't have ordered the Xscape dress that was super flattering, I absolutely would have felt great wearing this dress to a ball. I really cannot believe how great the quality is for this low price! LOVE it! Read more",

        "body": "This dress is beautiful. I ordered 3 to ensure I got the size right. I am 5’9 175 with a smaller chest and larger bottom. It suggested the large was the right size for me - it was very form fitting - which I don’t love. The XL was very roomy and comfortable and just left me feeling more comfortable - I did still wear spanx (just my comfort zone). If you are comfortable and confident with your body, order the suggested size. If you are less comfortable or like a roomier fit, size up. Oddly, the green came with a zipper in the back (xl). The blue (l and xl) did not. It wasn’t needed due to the wide neck - just stepped right in. The material is very thick so covers problem areas. Length was amazing - plenty of length for heels if you want or it liked great dragging a bit. Exceptional dress for a great price! Read more",

        "body": "This dress is stunning. I'm 5\"3 with narrow waist and curvy hips and ordered based on hip measurements. I did have to have it tailored because it was too long and too much fabric on top. Absolutely worth it though! I received many compliments. I did take one star off because although the fabric is thick and feels great, it snags incredibly easily. I'll likely only get a few wears out of it before it's too snagged. Also the dye bleeds badly. I had a French manicure for the formal event and my hands and nails were completely black by the end of the night. It was quite embarrassing. Read more",

However, BOTH of the \"new\" dresses that were sent to me were very clearly used. One had cat scratches and cat hair all over it, and the other had deodorant stains and was inside out. It's a shame I now have to go to one of the drop off spots because they keep sending me used things. I had 7 things shipped, and of those, ONE was new. You can tell because they now send it back directly in the plastic bags people return them in. Gross and lazy. Read more",
