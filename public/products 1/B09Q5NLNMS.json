        "body": "I literally just took the dress out and tried it on and had to hop onto Amazon to do a quick review. I am going to a masquerade party so needed a more dramatic looking dress. I am bottom heavy and have gained a few pounds in the past couple of months so I’m kind of in between between sizes L and XL. Some of the new weight is around my stomach and have a bit of a booty. So I haven’t been feeling like buying new things. Just tried it on and omg it was perfect. I ordered a Large and it fit perfectly. The quality was 10 times better than I had anticipated because let’s be real sometimes clothes online look good, but the material is a little bit flimsy. This is not it. It’s a nice thick quality, the sleeves stand up dramatically, and the draping in the front hide any sign of tummy rolls. The material is thick so doesn’t show any cellulite or dimples. It does run more on the slightly larger size that’s why the Large fit me perfectly. Very comfortable. The slit is high enough to be sexy but not so high that it’s tricky to walk around. I’m actually excited now to go to this party. Get the dress!!! Read more",

The fit of the dress was slightly off and a little too big on some areas and fitting in others. The quality of the material was excellent but it has a smell that took a few days to disappear. I would've taken it to the cleaners but it arrived on a Friday night and the event was on a Sunday. I don't know if I'll ever wear it again and I definitely wouldn't buy it again. Now I know why everyone was saying they took it to the tailor but if you buy an inexpensive dress do you want to take it to a tailor? Read more",
