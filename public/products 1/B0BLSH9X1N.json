        "body": "I bought this dress to replace and old Ralph Lauren dress that got damaged and for years I've had no luck, I just wanted something simple, but nice fitting and not inchy, I seen this dress and so I ordered it. Once it arrived, I tired it on, the fit was just perfect, even in the length! I have long arms for a petite person so I always had to order a Misses size 4 or 2 in a blazer or a petite size 8 for the sleeves to come down to the end of my wrist touching the top of my hand. Now unless you are a petite 6 or 8 or a Misses size 4-6 you can not wear a small. I am 5'1\" weight 118 and you see that this knit dress fits great, I am thin, but with a little bit of hips and backside and you see how the small fits me, I am strictly a petite 6-8 and a Misses 2-4 in dress most skirts, pants and tops which is a x -small and a small if it womens and a small in Petite depending on the cut fabric and what country it's made in, but ladies, this stretchy knit dress fits perfectly and it doesn't runs small it's true to size, for someone taller but around the same weight and size as I, the length would be shorter on you, this is the perfect length for me. NO, it is not thick or thin knit, it's medium weight and perfect for 60° and below fall, winter and early spring climates/temps and if you want the knecline shorter, you can roll it down and or double folder it down, you can also strunch the neck down and scarf it. If there are no cleaning instructions; Machine hand washing cycle or delicate using woolite, gentle spin, lay flat to dry even if you have to use your ironing board to do so. I worked in retail for maaaany years and I know may fabrics and you don't want this dress to loose shape, softness, perfect color and life span wear, Some fabris can loose all if this, especially using the wrong detergent, it can shorten the life expectancy of the fabric.
