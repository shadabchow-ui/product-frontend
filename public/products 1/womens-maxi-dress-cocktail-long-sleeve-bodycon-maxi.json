The material was heavy, yet thin, there's a very flimsy white elastic band that's used to help hold the top up in place. Out of the packaging you can't really tell how the top part is suppoae to fit. It just felt as if I was wearing a potato sack bag. It may fit those curvier better than someone small in size. I'm 5'5\" tall and 102lbs just to give an idea for those like me looking for a dress.
