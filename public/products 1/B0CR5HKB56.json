        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars I like everything about this dress (+ Oct. update).",
        "body": "This dress is all the things the reviews say it is. The fit is tts, pockets are a win, light-weight, scuba type fabric is super comfy and the underarm coverage is nice. I’m 5’6 and the length was fine. It would be great for travel and for casual to dressy events. The price point is fair. I’m ready to order other colors! UPDATE: A “Limited Time” offer was sent in this dress, so I ordered the Navy, Olive & Blush Pink colors (late Oct.) Got the first two immediately, but the pink was delayed. (I canceled the pink, b/c I needed it right away.) Love them. The light-weight, scuba type fabric seems the exact same to me, in all three colors. It’s too cool for winter, so I’ll have to layer. I wear a half-slip in the summer & winter, which helps to smooth things out. I’m short waisted and the dresses look great with a drop waist belt. I’d like more colors and a long sleeve, heavier weight fabric version of this dress would be great. Read more",

It has pockets also. It is loosely fitted. Not snug but not baggy. My sister got the Royal blue in Medium. She is 5’8” around 140lbs. She could have gotten away with small due to her size. But length would have been a little shorter. It hits right about ankle length. I wore slip on wedges. My sister wore tennis shoes. It would look good with heels also! The material is really soft.

        "body": "This dress is very nice and surprisingly well made. It is extremely flattering - cut well and fits perfectly. One very helpful plus is that the dress was designed with fabric under each arm hole to hide your bra strap. This has been a problem with many sleeveless shirts and dresses I’ve tried on, so I really appreciate that detail. The fabric is very soft and feels much more expensive than expected - it feels like a luxury brand, with the softness rivaling the LOFT Lou & Grey signaturesoft fabric. We’ll see how it holds up over time. I’m planning on dry cleaning it to preserve the fabric. I am 5’7, 137 lbs and I ordered a small, which fits perfectly. I ordered coffee brown, which I turned out to be a beautiful rich color. I will be ordering a couple more of these! Read more",

I haven't wore it without sleeves as I pair it with an over sized sweater and wore a belt to tuck in the front of the weather and it looks so cute! I will be wearing this dress a lot as it's fine for every season! I would highly recommend! I want another for a backup. It hits 2-3 inches from my ankle. I am 5'8\" and 215ish on a good day.
