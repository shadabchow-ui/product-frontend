        "body": "I tried this dress hoping it will slim me a bit and still feel good enough to not feel like i am wearing an unbreathable shapewear. It’s truly amazing. Fits like a glove! I have a bit of a tummy and this doesn’t totally get rid of it, but gives me a smoothed out look and makes me feel confident. There’s a bodysuit inside so you have to slowly shimmy it up like you are putting on pants. Slow and steady wins the race for this dress haha. But once in place, it feels amazing and is a nice quality. Does not feel cheap. The black is super classy, and i bet the other colors look nice. I for into and xl perfectly fine and yes it was a struggle to get on at the beginning. Very easy to take off though. I am 5’5” small chest and bigger stomach, hips and thighs. Roughly 190lbs give or take. Hope that helps, if you’re on the fence just try it. It also looked nice as a strapless! Not sure it can be worn that way but I’d def get it as a tube dress for sure!

It was mostly flattering and it's still in the running for my work holiday party but it's just so tight at the waist, I'm not sure I can wear it all night. There was so much relief taking it off after only wearing it for 20 minutes. I don't really need that much compression at my waist, most of my weight is in my thighs. I love that it molded to everything though. Normally dresses like this are loose in my waist. It's very rare for something to feel too tight in the waist and also fit my thighs! In fact, I probably could have gone up to a medium but I got a small. I haven't decided if I'm returning this. And yes, like the other reviews said, it's HARD to get on. You definitely have to do the side to side hip shimmy. Once it was up over my butt then it was smooth sailing! Read more",
