        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars The perfect little black dress",
        "body": "I recently received this women’s satin strapless mini black dress for my daughters winter dance and she loved this dress so much. It was exactly her style and it looked beautiful on her. The black color with sparkly detailing added just the right amount of glam to her look. Despite being a strapless style, this dress stayed perfectly in place throughout the night, even on my daughter who isn't particularly busty. I was initially concerned about the fit, but the size small we ordered fit her like a glove. For reference, she's about 5'1 tall and wears an extra small in most clothing. The stretchy fabric hugged her curves in all the right places without feeling too tight or restrictive. The side slit added a fun and flirty touch without being too revealing. I was worried that the dress was going to be too short and her bottom might poke out the back but luckily that was not an issue. This dress was also long enough. She just looked elegant and beautiful. This dress was very easy to pair shoes, a bag, and jacket with as well. Shipping was a breeze, and the package arrived right on time. Everything was packaged securely so there were no worries about damaged. The sizing, color, and display photo all matched the dress. To order something online and it look exactly like the photo but it also fits you amazingly is rare when you shop online. But it happened, and my daughter was very thankful. We opted to hand wash the dress and let it air dry to preserve the sparkle and glitter and it turned out beautifully. The dress is now in her closet and still looks as new as the day it arrived. The quality of this dress exceeded my expectations, especially considering the affordable price point. My daughter felt absolutely beautiful and confident in it, which is all I could ask for. Plus, it was super easy to find shoes and a bag to match. Overall, I would highly recommend this dress to anyone looking for a stylish and affordable option for a special occasion. It definitely deserves a solid 5/5 rating! Read more",
