The one thing I don't like is that the lining is a little too short for a sheer dress, I wish it was the same length as the tulle, then this would be the perfect dress! You can wear this dress with a bra surprisingly and the straps don't show even though the sleeves are sheer, the stitching provides coverage on the shoulders! This dress hides the armpit area that I'm always looking to cover! It's a great design and great shape! Very flattering and super stretchy! This fit while pregnant and before/after through all of my weight changes! I love it! The dress is lightweight and breathable! Such a great value because it looks thick and eexpensive but is not a bad price at all! Highly recommend this dress for all occasions! I bought it in green too to use for Christmas pictures! I ordered this in Medium and Large and both fit well but I kept the medium so I could wear it after pregnancy, the medium is the one in photos I posted, but both sizes looked the same and were a great fit!

        "body": "The number of stars is based on honestly how this was handled. I received returned merchandise.. yes, the dress still had a tag on it, but the bag itself was cut open. It didn’t get taped to seal it again. It was wide open that if I didn’t have a decent delivery driver, they could’ve stole that dress… it does have a slight odor also. Other than that, the dress has good lining not see-through at all the material seems very good quality, super easy to slide on and wear. I will say sizing told me to get an XL, but I went with a L, i am a 36DDD, 5’3, 170ish pound pear shaped woman. The dress is cute and I would’ve returned it and swapped it out for a not returned item, but sadly, it would not be here in time for the wedding. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Sleeveless is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",
