I took in the sides at the top & shortened the sleeve at my shoulder to make it fit nice & snug in the chest.

        "body": "Beautiful dress that was comfortable to wear and better quality than I expected. It did take a little effort to de-wrinkle the ruffles, but I think that's more of a that-kind-of-fabric-quirk than a this-dress-quirk. I'm short (5'3\") so even with heels on this dress was touch the floor long. I did feel like it fit true to size. I originally sized up and ended up exchanging for my actual size (XXL to xl). The bow pieces for the shoulder are long and could be tied in many ways. I meant to get assistance in actually tying mine in a prettier bow rather than the quick one I threw it into but forgot. The thigh slit didn't feel super obvious to me at all, and actually had trouble finding it some. The inner liner of the skirt and top layer with the ruffles have the slit in the same place but move around differently so theyre not always 100% lined up. It was easy to lift the dress and walk up/downstairs or wherever. Read more",

Having a proper length dress is a novel at my height, and the fit was true to size. The cup on the side without the strap had a great silicone band, and as a 44H, I was able to wear this dress comfortably and support with only the use of some KT tape to hold the girls up. The tulle is beautiful and the liner is smooth and not itchy. The dress is thick and textured enough to hide any problem areas/belly bulge that might make you self conscious.

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Evening One Shoulder Cocktail Maxi is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: #1 Dark Green, #1 Light Blue, #1 Navy Blue, #1 Wine Red, #1 Black. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
