        "body": "Product Review: Women's V-Neck Halter Fishtail Bandage Bodycon Dress (Royal Purple) I absolutely love this dress! The royal purple color is stunning and rich, making it perfect for a night out or a special occasion. The bandage material hugs my curves in all the right places, providing a sleek and sculpted look. It fit like a glove—snug but comfortable, giving me confidence with every step. The halter neckline adds an elegant touch, and the fishtail hem gives just the right amount of drama and flair. I received so many compliments throughout the night, with people asking where I got it. The quality is top-notch, and the fabric has a nice stretch while still feeling structured. If you're looking for a show-stopping dress that makes you feel amazing, this is the one! Highly recommend. Read more",

        "body": "This dress is stunning! The fit is incredibly flattering—form-fitting in all the right places—and it looks and feels way more expensive than it is. The seam quality is great, and it feels very structured with a thick, sturdy material that gives it a high-end look. Plus, it’s not see-through at all, which is a huge bonus for a white dress! I got so many compliments wearing it! The little flair at the bottom adds such a cute, feminine touch that makes the dress even more elegant. For reference, I’m 5’2” and around 120 lbs, and the small fit great. The only small downside is that the neck strap is a little loose if you’re on the shorter side—I wish it were tighter or adjustable. But even with this flaw, it didn’t compromise the overall look of the dress. Absolutely worth it for the price—such a showstopper! Read more",

It’s a great quality, thick material with the right amount of stretch and a sturdy, gold zipper up the back to give you a tailored fit. I’m curvy, 140ish, 5’7, 34 DD, 28” waist and 39” hips. I ordered a S and M - both fit similar in the hip but, the M top was a tad looser. Even though the extra strap length was nice, I was afraid the top would gap. Both would have worked but I chose the S. I am wearing the S in this picture. Read more",

I had to keep readjusting to prevent my bra from showing. Maybe I should have used some double-sided tape on my bra. The material is thicker than expected and the dress is form-fitting. The gold color is quite pretty, too. It looked good on me but would look really fabulous on curvier women with nice booties, which I don’t have. Read more",

        "body": "The media could not be loaded. This dress was so beautiful and feminine. It solved all my problem area (stomach). My colleague shared a picture with me when she wore the dress to a wedding. I purchased the dress and couldn't even wait for the wedding. I wore it for my birthday instead. I love the thick material and stretch. It's like wearing a bandad. It snaps everything in place. The material feels high quality—thick, stretchy, and it hugs the body beautifully without being uncomfortable. The bandage design really cinches in the waist and gives a flattering hourglass shape. The V-neck halter style adds a touch of elegance while still being sexy, and the fishtail hem gives it that extra wow factor. I received several compliments throughout the night, and it photographed beautifully! I love that it stayed in place all evening—no need to constantly adjust. I would recommend sizing up if you prefer a bit more comfort since it’s a true bodycon fit. Perfect for weddings, cocktail events, or date nights. Highly recommend if you want a bold, elegant look that turns heads! Can't wait to wear it again. Read more",

        "body": "I had such a love/hate experience with this dress. I see so many great reviews for it, and I feel like my luck was just against me with this one. I’ll start with the positives, first. 1) The dress fabric weight was amazing! It is a true bandage dress that is heavy and a good thickness. If other issues hadn’t been wrong with the dress, I’m sure I would have been in love as when I did try it on, as it hugged every curve in the best way. 2) The color was true to description and beautiful! 3) the gold zipper on the back was gorgeous! Negatives: I had ordered the same dress in a medium in a different color; wasn’t a fan of the color on me, and felt like maybe it was just a tad too tight for a wedding, so I returned that one and ordered a large. WOAH!! What a huge size jump! 1) The new dress (size large in wine) I received definitely had some manufacturing errors, or had been worn and stretched out SIGNIFICANTLY!!!! The neckline was so stretched out to the point it made a wave on my chest. Either the proportions were off, or like I said, someone had worn it. Also, the seams on the sides of the dress were crooked, making the dress bunch in areas along the hips. I tested my theory my of the dress proportions being off by folding the dress in half length wise, and seeing if the two halves were the same. They were NOT! One side of the dress was at least 1 inch wider than the other!!! This caused it to fit extremely weird. Soooo….I ordered a replacement. The SECOND dress arrived…..this dress had DEFINITELY been worn!!!!! The hanger straps had been cut off, the dress had little picks all over it from someone clearly wearing it. It also smelled like it had been worn, and there was clear deodorant residue where the dress touched the underarms. The proportions were accurate on this (used the same method to test), but I was not going to wear a dress that someone else had worn. It really sucked because the dress had so much potential, but that’s why you always have a back up for special events. So when ordering, proceed with caution. If I had had enough time before the wedding, I would have gone through the process of contacting Amazon and ordered a third dress and crossed my fingers it would be better. Just not enough time.
