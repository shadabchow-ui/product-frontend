It has a lot of stretch and give all over. I have a large chest (38J) and it accommodate my size very well. It's stunning. I didn't have time to swap it for a large because I bought it for a specific occasion and would not have had chance to get a new one. It looks good and I am comfortable with it. The colors a deep forest green. It pair well with my brown eyes. I love the fabric and it has a high quality feel. It will last a while with proper care. I'll probably dry clean it occasionally.

The fabric was soft but substantial, not see-through. The ruching stayed in place and was very complementary to my figure. I am giving the dress itself five stars however obviously somebody else had tried this on previously that is a smoker. It came to me unzipped, balled up in a torn plastic bag, wrinkled and smelly. I need this dress ASAP and will keep it but I’m not happy with how it arrived. I was thinking about buying additional dresses from the same company, however I am wondering if it will arrive in good condition. Do returned items get inspected before being sent back out?

  "long_description": "Womens Dress V Neck Sleeveless Bodycon Cocktail Ruched is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Nude-pink, Sequin-black, Wine-red, Rose-red, Glitter-navy, Rust-red, Glitter-purple, Black, Light-blue, Glitter-peacock-blue, Army-green, Grey-blue, Red, Royal-blue. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
