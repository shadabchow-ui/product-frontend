        "body": "This dress is actual perfection! It is so classy and the sleeves are beautiful. I'm in between and 8 and 10 so I got a large thinking it would be a bodycon type....the fabric is stretchy but it is not that soft cotton stretch. It's a dressier more elegant fabric that has some body to it. It's the perfect cocktail dress and I felt so beautiful in it. It's been a while since I was happy with the way my body looked in slim fitting clothing as I am menopausal. This one is a winner....I can't wait to wear it for the holiday season. Get this...you won't be sorry. Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress Cocktail Bodycon is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: A-hot Pink, Blue, Black. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
