It’s pretty low cut in the front which I’m not used to flaunting but my husband thought it was perfect ;) I’m chubby and over 40 so finding a dress is stressful and not fun- but this dress camouflaged all my insecurities. The material is light, stretchy, and drapes beautifully, it flowed while walking which made me feel like a princess. I’m a little taller than 5’7 and with heels this still dusted the floor.

        "body": "This dress runs a full size too big. Very low cut especially if you have a full bust… lots of cleavage. Size down if between sizes. At 5’8”, 140 lb, size 6 was right size for me. Fabric is a soft and stretchy knit, but not particularly high quality. However, you are unlikely to wear this type of dress very often, so maybe not a big factor in purchase. Silver metallic vertical stripe woven into fabric gives the sparkle appearance. Sleeves are more of three quarter unless you are short. Length is ok for me with flat or a very low heel. Not overly dressy for a formal. So, will definitely need to accessorize. A great choice for an inexpensive formal if it is unlikely to be worn often. Very forgiving style, likely to look good on most figures. Colors aren’t bright… green is a very dark Hunter green. Read more",

        "body": "So, I love this dress when I tried it on. It is beautiful, breathable and made my girls look good. The sleeves was just a tad short. Now, why I gave this a 3 is because when I washed this dress and I followed the instructions and I did not dry it I hung it to dry. It did not look the same as when I tried it on originally. It didnt hold up it got a small hole in the sleeve and the bottom of the dress looked a little frayed. So I didnt get to wear it as I went with my back up from Torrid. Which I am still sad about because its was a beautiful dress but I dont buy clothes to wear once and not be able to wash it or dry clean it. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve Formal Evening is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.",
