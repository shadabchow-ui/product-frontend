But it came with small pads sewn into the bust, which seems really silly for a gown with sleeves and lining.. (I could understand if it were strapless or sheer). They looked ridiculous on my already ample bust, so I paid a tailor to remove them, and it fit better, looked nice. But then came the wedding.. the sequins on the sleeves attached themselves to the body of the dress any time my arms were down at my sides, and my pianist and I literally had to rip threads to unattach my arms from my body. I could not get it off fast enough once the wedding was over.. literally took it off in the car and drove home in my coat. So, I'll never wear it again, and I can't return it because I had it altered. Very disappointed. :( Read more",
