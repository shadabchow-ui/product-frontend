I really wish it was softer or even linen. I ordered a size up because I was worried about the tightness of fabric below my bust, and im glad I did because it would have been difficult to get over my shoulders and chest. I normally wear an XL top and I got a XXL. I do like the fact that it is very flowy and the perfect length. Im 5'2\" and it hits at the knee and a little longer in the back which is great for us big bum ladies. I was going to return but my husband likes it on me. Also the flowers are a pale yellow, not white in case anyone was wondering. Read more",

For reference I am a solid size 12,pear shaped,the large fit perfectly. Nicely fitted on the top without feeling tight. Love the flutter sleeves. The bottom flairs out a bit. It hits just above the knees. I love the crossover top. On me (38C) it didn’t gape open nor was it too low cut or revealing. I would definitely feel comfortable wearing it to church. It conceals any flaws in your midsection,really flattering on. I bought the red one with little white flowers. I’m going to order a couple more.

Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Floral-32, Apricot Floral-78, Blue White Floral-82, Floral-15, Floral-70, Black, Yellow Floral-87, Red White Floral-85, Blue White Paisley-73, Apricot Orange Floral-79, White Blue Floral-63, Floral-44, Floral-27, Blue. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
