        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Love this dress. Buy it!",
        "body": "I have three of this dress, that's how much I love it. It's going to work on a variety of body types because of the tie back, and just in general it's quite flattering and forgiving especially in the tummy area. I have an hourglass body type with really huge boobs, a small waist and big hips / bum so this style with waist emphasis works really well for me and had enough room for my boobs so that's a huge win right there. I like that this isn't a bodycon dress so you could wear it to an event where you might be having a big meal and since it's a flowing skirt no need to worry about that food baby look. This can also be styled of variety of different ways and there's so many color options. I got the dark red for a fall wedding. But I also own the black as an excellent basic and the baby blue with short sleeves for spring and summer. It's a really comfortable beautiful dress, something about it maybe the flowingness and the material feel very romantic and feminine. It's definitely more well made than the average inexpensive Amazon garment, you know how you'll get something and the fabric will be so cheap it feels like paper? That is not this at all. This feels like a substantial well-made piece of clothing. The black and the baby blue that I own are a couple years old and they still look new. Another thing I really appreciate about this dress is it's neither too warm nor leaves me too cold. I have tons of clothes from Amazon and I would say this is one of the best made inexpensive things I've ever gotten and absolutely perfect as a wedding guest dress or a date night dress. If this dress went out of style I would be so bummed because it's seriously my go-to for weddings. It's beautiful but not too sexy nor to frumpy. Very much in that just right type of bracket. Buy it! You'll probably be back for another color. Read more",

        "body": "Very very pretty dress, no zipper it’s all elastic so it’s easy to put on but you’ll need help with the tie straps for the back, sometimes the shoulders fall a little but overall it’s a great dress, probably doesn’t look that good with a bra on but I still got compliments even with a mismatched bra color on. The sizing was great and the stretchiness is immaculate however it’s a little tight near the waist area under the boob area. It’s very comfortable I was wearing it for my birthday for around 9 hours and it didn’t feel that uncomfortable. Overall I would buy again especially since I’m eyeing the black dress now :3 Read more",

        "body": "I'm 5'4\", and weigh 108lbs, wear 30c, xs in women's, not big in the butt or chest area. Bought the xs in black. It's cute and the material feels good, besides the waistband. However, the sleeves are short when wearing on your shoulders. The elastic part on the sleeve hits about 2\" higher than the wrist when worn on the shoulder (which feels awkward and weird); off the shoulder - it's great. The waistband is a little scratchy for my preference. The dress hits a little lower than mid thigh. Returning it because I hated the way the elastic on the sleeves felt. The dress had no weird smell but it is wrinkly. Read more",

        "body": "I was skeptical about this dress, I’ve never bought clothes from Amazon, but I just liked this dress so much I had to try it and when I tell you it’s perfect, it. is. perfect!! I bought this as a dress to wear to my boyfriend’s brother’s wedding (which is tropical cocktail attire). As a bigger girl, size 16/18 I was nervous as to whether the stretch was actually stretchy and would the sheer sleeves actually fit my arms, both of which were easily assured when I tried the dress on. Let’s start with the sleeves, very sheer, just a single thin layer, but very roomy and loose, perfect for an outdoor summer event. The neckline was a little loose, it definitely won’t stay up on my shoulders but that’s fine. I ordered an XXL, so if I had sized down I’m sure it would have fit better, but it doesn’t bother me. The bust is also a teeny tiny bit sheer, but nothing a sticky bra or boob tape wouldn’t fix. The waistline is flattering and has a great amount of stretch to accommodate a larger body or bust. The skirt flairs out perfectly and the length is perfect too. I was a little worried it would be too short for a family affair, but it hits right at my knee, for reference I’m 5’7” with most of my height in my torso. I’m excited to wear this dress this summer, and if you’re on the fence I HIGHLY encourage you try this dress Read more",

I put it in my cart for one and then ordered it and it showed up with 5 dresses since I needed it so soon I couldn’t have canceled it and tried to order it again. i went to try this on and i am more on the taller side (5’5) so i went to try this on and the sleeves where wayyy to short they where by my elbows. The dress was too thin to be able to wear on halloween. But it was a very pretty dress it had a lot of flow to it which made it fun to wear. so overall i give this a three star. Read more",
