        "body": "Got this for an upcoming costume party, and I don't think I've been this excited to dress up since I was a kid! If I had seen this in a store, I would have expected the dress to cost more! It's a good quality, lined, beading and fringe looks so awesome. It zips on the side, and the straps are adjustable. The straps are a bit thin/narrow, but still seem sturdy. I ordered a medium, I'm 5'2\", current weight is 155 and 38D, it fits pretty well, it's a smidge snug but not uncomfortable at all (I planned on losing a few pounds, but that didn't happen lol). If you prefer for it to be a bit loose, go with a large. But if you're around 125-155ish, a medium would probably work. And the straps can be let out if you aren't a shorty like me! Read more",

I am 5’3 and 168 pounds I got a large I have a hourglass figure and it fits like a glove. I slid it on and did not need to use the zipper. The tassels go a little bit below my knees, but it will be perfect for dancing. The zipper has a weird bin to it, but I’m going to iron it straight. I love the dress. I will put pictures up on New Year’s Eve. At the Gatsby Ball in Las Vegas, The only reason I gave it a four star because the zipper has a bend in it and it will not lay flat so I will iron it.

The zipper can get snagged on the fabric so be careful, but that’s just the nature of the fabric, not indicative of quality. Such a great find for the price. Read more",

        "body": "A great value dress! I bought the medium, I'm 5'2\" and 155lb. The dress fits a little tight on the hips, but not uncomfortably. It stretches nicely and provides plenty of coverage on the chest for my 36C. I make costumes and was pretty impressed with the quality of the beaded/sequins fabric, fringe, and even the zipper (which I did not need to open to slip into the dress, but tested it afterward nonetheless). Other than the occasional stray thread, very well made for the price and very comfortable. I bought it a week in advanced of my event to give myself time to return it if needed for a different size or better quality dress or to air it out if I wanted to keep it. I don't need to do either. No smell, and I'll be keeping this for my event. I'm so excited! Read more",

I am typically a size six and this fit me perfectly on the bottom, but gaped and puckered alarmingly in the armpits, and the only way to stop my boobs from falling out when leaning over is to tighten the straps so much it practically looks like a sleeveless dress instead of a strappy dress. The combo of the fringe and sequin is very fun but a step up from just sequins dresses. Construction is on par with other flapper dresses at this price point. I do wish the fringe was a bit thicker, or there were one or two more rows, since the placement left it feeling a little bit sparse at times, compared to other similar dresses at this price point. if you have a larger chest and you're looking for a comfortable sexy 80's does 20's flapper dress for a night out, you'll probably enjoy this. I don't so I don't, but you might. do please note I've caught several brands listing completely different 20's dresses in older listings in order to keep the ratings, so make sure to check customer photos and dates to make sure that they're actually reviewing the same dress that you're buying.
