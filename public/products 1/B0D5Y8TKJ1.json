        "body": "I am a plus size woman who usually wears in between size 16 to 18 in dresses. This dress was very cute and flattering. I will note that I am not wearing any shape wear or the proper undergarments in this picture. I quickly snapped this when I was trying it on. It was very comfortable and I felt that I would have been able to move in it easy. It also has just the perfect amount of shimmer in it so it wasn't just a \"plain\" black dress. Lastly, I have a large chest and often have problems with it not being covered fully when I wear dresses. I appreciated that this dress actually had a button in the area to prevent that from happening. Ultimately, I am returning it because I went with another dress option. However, I would definitely recommend this to a friend if they needed one! Read more",
