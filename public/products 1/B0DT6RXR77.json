The fabric of the dress is thick but incredibly forgiving in its stretch making it insanely comfortable to wear & accommodates different body types and very different bust sizes. 🍈 I do think that you need a B size cup to fill out the bust area but as you can see from the pictures anyone from a B size to a DD can fit in the medium dress. I’m pairing it with a lightweight summer sweater that doesn’t work with a bow in the back. Thankfully the length of the fabric for the bow is long enough for me to cross it in the back & make a small tie up front under my bust. Read more",
