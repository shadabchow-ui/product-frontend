The fabric is lightweight yet structured, offering just the right amount of stretch for comfort.

I purchased this in my pre-pregnancy size despite having a bump and this still fit great with lots of room for stretch while maintaining its shape. The material is not see-through, the quality is good for the price, and I received lots of compliments on the color and style. I also washed this in the washer and laid it out to dry and it has held up with no damage. The only downside is that the frilly shoulder pieces lay a bit funny so the seams show sometimes and the waist seam is not a true empire waist so it sat across my bump leading me to pull it up a bit (but that shouldn’t be a problem if you aren’t pregnant).

I wanted something that was formal enough that I could wear it there but not too much that I would be able to get many more wears out of it. this is great for weddings, graduation, fancy dinners, formal dances, etc. very comfortable and very soft, the fringe that comes down is a great touch that makes it more formals the color is exactly as pictured, not see through at all, doesn’t ride up, it fits great i ordered a size small and can wear anything between a small to a large because of my chest and this fit perfectly i am about 165 lbs, 5’5, and wear a 34DDD. amazing dress for a low cost Read more",

Tried this in the lighter pink which just didn’t work for my skin tone so i opted for the magenta and never looked back. Beyond comfortable and loved the details. The fabric was great and not too thin or thick for a Florida event. Shape hugs you and the fit was true to size even with baby bump. Strongly recommended! Read more",
