        "body": "Formal events are a constant, in my line of work. I needed a black cocktail dress that not only looked great, but it also has to hold up to excess movement. I have never owned a bandage dress, because they never seemed formal enough for my purposes. Also, I'm a stickler for quality material. This dress did not disappoint!! The material is thick and it does not buckle, bunch, fray or pill. On the model, the dress sits above the knee, but on me it the prefect midi length, making it look more classy. I purchased the small (I'm 5'6', 120 lbs). My 34b bust compliment the top of the dress very well, so I have no need for a bra or nipple covers. I will buy a second one in Black, to have as a back-up, since this dress is considered a \"uniform\", but I'm not gonna take a change on any other colors because, given the type of \"bandage\" material, I can see how the fabric could look like it's something is wrong with it. Overall, this is a GREAT dress for the price. Hurry up and get it, before they seller realizes what a gem it is. Read more",

My boobs were SPILLING out of this and they're really not that big lol. It felt like it smooshed my butt in and didn't do much for my belly. So medium fit, but lg prob would've been PERFECT. I tried it on and never wore it again, its still in its packaging and wrapped in the paper lol. I wish I returned it. It is very heavy/durable material! It's great material. I can see this dress looking great on others and the black or red large probably would've looked great on me. The gold just didn't look good with my complexion, either. I look good in gold jewelry, but this just wasn't it for me in any way. I would still recommend this dress even though the color and size was off for me. It's great quality. Read more",

My waist is small tho and I wear a 36B bra. The dress fit perfectly except it was too big on the waist and wasn’t snatching me in. I sewed in 2 inches off the waist on each side and then it was a perfect fit. I’m glad I did because the medium may have been too tight around my hips. The large gave my hips breathing room so the dress didn’t ride up while I was walking/dancing. Also… I wore this to an event at a night club. I danced the entire night and was drenched in sweat. This dress did NOT show any sweat stains. The bathroom video shows me at the end of the night all sweaty but no stains on the dress- It was remarkable! Definitely worth the money- I’m going to buy more colors. Read more",
