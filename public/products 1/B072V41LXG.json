    "customers_say": "Customers find the dress stunning for engagement photos and appreciate its amazing quality and comfort, with one noting it doesn't feel cheap. The fit and sizing receive mixed feedback - while some say it fits amazing, others report issues with the chest area being too big and the dress being too short for their body. Moreover, the cut is criticized for being very low in the chest area, and the zipper quality is poor, with customers reporting issues with it not having holes and being difficult to use. Additionally, the dress is see-through in the back, though it effectively hides the belly.

        "body": "OVERALL SIZE: I am 5'6, 36C and about ~170 and ordered size L, fit was great - not too tight anywhere but not noticeably loose. The lace pattern was really nice for concealing any body shape you're shy about - normally I would wear spanx to squeeze in my belly, but it didn't feel necessary in this outfit. I got lots of compliments and it felt like the right blend of dressy/comfortable for a cocktail attire outdoor wedding. LENGTH: The dress part was floor length, raised up about 1\" off the floor when I wore 3\" wedges. BUST: The v-neck is DEEP. Went down pretty much right above my navel. I followed other reviewers' lead and ended up stitching up the bottom 5-6\" with red thread, until the v was even with my cleavage. This tightened the chest a bit but not uncomfortably. I had trouble finding a bra or even deep-V body suit that would fit this (halter strap would show at the top, back of the dress is see through so most bras were out, and the deep v ruled out the rest), so I ended up using pasties and boob tape to great effect. COMFORT: The material is a little scratchy, but overall not bad. I wore the dress to a summer wedding that was supposed to be outdoors but moved inside due to rain - I was pretty comfortable throughout. The lace lets a little air flow.
