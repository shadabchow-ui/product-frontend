Simple to dress up with a couple of bracelets and a necklace- nude sandals... It felt fabulous. I would buy it in every color LOL! I am a little busty and most dresses that fit that area are huge and hang- but this one fit perfectly and flattered my figure. I wish I had a picture!! It was the best buy for me of all the clothes I bought this past year. I liked that it DID not have pockets as that makes the dress wide at the hips. Super comfortable and just beautiful in black.

It accentuates curves and gives you a cute figure; however, it is not tight-fitting. I bought this dress for work and love the quality. It does not have pockets and is not see-through. It is not overly thick. It can be worn in both summer and fall/spring. The sleeveless dress makes it very breathable. I look forward to pairing this with different shoes to dress up my daily work attire. The only reason I gave it a 4-star is because the style is not my absolute favorite.

It’s a very sophisticated look which you can dress up with your favorite jewelry or keep it simple for work or around town. It’s that comfortable! The only negative and I didn’t take away a star for, is that be careful when applying deodorant with a light-colored dress and allow it to dry throughly before wearing because it will cause a temporary wet stain, but will eventually dry. It is unsightly, put I now know. I highly recommend this dress, especially at this low price! Read more",

        "body": "This is my Goldilocks dress - JUST RIGHT! I am 5’0”, 40-33-40 and Amazon recommended a large. This is the perfect work dress for me as a teacher. Bought one and threw it on after some sprays of Downey wrinkle release for the vacuum sealed wrinkles and was out the door in 5 minutes. Wore it for a hour and then literally ordered 6 more in different colors for about $100! So cheap, but doesn’t look it. And because I live in SoCal, I can wear it year round by layering. No lining and no pockets, but that’s better for the weather here anyway. And the material just slinks over your body, thick enough to not show any lumps and bumps, but thin enough to not be hot. The top fits correctly, and the darting allows it to hug the girls without leaving gaping holes in the armpit. The waist was loose enough to move comfortably, but fitted enough to not look like a sack. The bottom was a loose enough to not show any VPL, but not a swing or trapeze shape. It’s the perfect length on me. I’m so short that most “short” dresses go past my knee, but this one is right above it. When you sit, it will ride up, and the slit on the side will go higher, so it may be more of a tunic length for you taller ladies, but won’t be indecent if you wear bike shorts under them just in case the slit rides too high. For summer, I threw on some sandals. For work, I can throw some heels on for big presentations, or wear sneakers for running around and still look professional while being comfortable and still able to get down on the ground, if needed. Most of the colors are discounted right now, so my fellow professional shorties- scoop them up now before they realize what they have! UPDATE- the dress is still awesome. I’ve gotten several compliments. Navy and black are my favorites. I ended up returning the lighter colors I got. The dresses were cut exactly the same, but the colors didn’t looks right on my complexion and some had a shine to them that was more obvious on the lighter colors that made the material look cheaper, and the seams more visible. I still highly recommend them in darker colors. Read more",
