        "body": "The dress is absolutely beautiful but there are so many flaws in the stitching. I expect address that cost almost $70 would have better attention paid to those details. These aren't small flaws, the seams are brunched and bunched where they should be straight causing strange bulges. The worst of it is on the front seam just above the split, which is very visible when wearing and makes the front of the dress look like it has been snagged and pulled. The sewing quality is really sad because overall the dress fits and feels like an absolute dream. Thankfully it isn't a total waste because I can add this to my costume bin and use it for the Ren Faire. I'm just really sad that I won't be able to use it for its intended purpose as a mother of the groom dress for a winter wedding. Read more",

It also was cut just low/wide enough in the back that the edges of my bra showed which was frustrating. I wore this as part of my Halloween costume so the quality from that standard was good, but for a general semi formal dress it would have been unacceptable in my opinion.
