        "body": "The skirt is exactly what I expected. It's basically snow pants for mild, snowy weather but as a skirt. It fits true to size, and I think that the quality is pretty decent. It goes over my clothes, the style is nice, and I will probably wear this as long as it holds up. I think the zipper quality is fine, but I have not taken this out for a test drive. I'm adding a couple of pictures for some ideas for the designers. First of all, this is slick fabric (as it should be.) Since this goes the length of the body from the waist down, it would be very helpful to have a hook of some sort at the top. I would suggest a fabric flap with a snap. See my illustration. My other idea is that you consider that Waldorf and back to basic school teachers may be wearing this and might need to be able to ski in addition to just being outside. I suggest that you take the zipper to right above the knees and have that be where you can zip up, and then have another fabric flap with several fabric buttons that can allow the wearer to snap it shut or, if they need to, to open it so that they can ski in their skirts in inclement weather. This skirt is good for deflecting snow and retaining some warmth, but I would not wear it in seriously cold weather (under 15° f) for any length of time. I am a teacher in a back-to-nature school, and I'm going to have to look harder for some other insulated skirts for going outside with my classes. I will wear this outside with my classes and I will definitely wear it when we were going out on school field trips. But this isn't going to take me into the great white north. Read more",
