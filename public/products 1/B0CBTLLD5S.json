        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Love this green dress",
        "body": "I recently purchased this green velvet dress, and it absolutely exceeded my expectations. The deep emerald color is rich and vibrant — exactly the kind of shade that turns heads without being too flashy. The velvet fabric feels soft and luxurious, with just the right amount of sheen to catch the light in the most flattering way. The fit is true to size and incredibly flattering — it hugs in all the right places without feeling restrictive. I wore it to a fall wedding and received compliments all night. It’s warm enough for cooler weather but still breathable. I also appreciate the subtle details like the slightly puffed sleeves and the elegant neckline, which give it a timeless, vintage-inspired feel. If you're looking for a statement dress for the holidays, a winter party, or a formal evening out, this green velvet beauty is a winner. Just add a pair of gold heels and a bold lip, and you're good to go. Read more",
