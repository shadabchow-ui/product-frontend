        "body": "I was honestly so impressed with this LAGSHIAN one-shoulder maxi dress! The material has a nice stretch that hugs your shape without feeling tight, and the ruched detailing is super flattering... it hides any little imperfections and gives that smooth, hourglass look. The one-shoulder design makes it feel chic and classy, perfect for a wedding, evening event, or photoshoot. I wore it with heels and minimal jewelry and got so many compliments. The high split is tasteful... it adds a touch of glam without being too revealing. Fabric quality is surprisingly good for the price; it feels soft and comfortable, not cheap or see-through. I’d definitely recommend going true to size... the stretch helps if you’re between sizes. Overall, this is a beautiful, affordable statement dress that looks way more expensive than it is. Elegant, flattering, and confidence-boosting... I’ll definitely be ordering another color! Read more",

The only reason I am giving this a 4* review is - it appears that this was possibly returned after being worn. It appears that there is white threading from where a tag had been there, but was ripped out. Also, the normal loop that one shoulder dresses / shirts have (loop is probably not the correct term) that is used to hang the dress up, is missing. It could be that the dress was made without it, but that seems odd to me since the rest of the dress is so well made. Read more",
