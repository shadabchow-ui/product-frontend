I typically wear a medium and medium was my recommended size when I was ordering even based on the measurements but when I tried it on it was swallowing me. I returned the medium and exchanged it for a small. I will say the small is still loose around the hips and waist but fitted around the chest and arms. This could just be because I have a square shaped body type and the dress was designed for more of a peach shape. Though it’s more fitted in the chest it’s not too tight and comfortable to wear all day. I think it’s worth the purchase! Read more",

        "body": "I recently picked up the PrettyGarden brand dress in cream, and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. It’s a simple dress, but it has such a classic, timeless feel you can easily dress it up or down depending on the occasion. The material really surprised me it feels so soft and high-quality, especially for the price. It drapes beautifully and doesn’t wrinkle as easily as some other dresses I’ve owned in this style. Considering how affordable it is, I’d say it’s a fantastic value for money. As for the fit, it’s spot on. It hugs just enough to be flattering but still has a comfortable, easy-to-wear silhouette. It’s one of those dresses that you can throw on and instantly feel put together and the cream color is just the icing on the cake, so elegant and versatile. If you’re looking for a simple, classy dress that you’ll reach for time and time again, I’d definitely recommend this one. It’s quickly become a favorite in my wardrobe! Read more",

        "body": "I’m 5’0, 105lbs, 30DD, 26 inch waist. I usually wear size 2-4 and decided to get an xs so it would fit a bit tighter, but it was loose around my waist. It’s also longer than expected. I was thinking the dress would hit a few inches above my knees, but it’s sort of an awkward length, hitting exactly at my knees.

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Formal Cocktail Boat Neck Sleeveless is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.",

This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs.

Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters.
