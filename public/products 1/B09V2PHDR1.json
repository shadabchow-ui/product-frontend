        "body": "The QACOHU Summer Dress has quickly become one of my go-to teaching outfits. I am 5' 4\" and 185 lbs. I am wearing a size XL. I have this dress in three colors. The V-neck and ruffled short sleeves give it just the right touch of style, while the casual shift fit keeps it comfortable enough to wear all day in the classroom. What I love most is how easy, and effortless it is to slip on. I can move around, bend, reach, and sit with my students without worrying about the dress being too tight or restrictive. At the same time, it looks polished and professional—perfect for parent meetings or after-school events. The fabric is lightweight and breathable, which makes it ideal for long school days and warm weather. Paired with flats or sandals, it’s a simple but put-together look. Highly recommend—this dress strikes the balance every teacher needs: stylish enough to feel confident, and practical enough to get through a busy school day. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Short Sleeve V Neck is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress Short Sleeve V Neck is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: C-mandala, D-geometry, Black, D3-swiss Dot Rose, C-coconut Leaves, A0-grey Pink, C1-white/Blue, C1-blue/White, D3-swiss Dot Beige, A0-roseo, C-black Flower, C1-blue Flowers, C-white Flower Navy, D3-swiss Dot Black. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
