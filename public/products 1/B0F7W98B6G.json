        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars FLATTERING, CUTE & COMFORTABLE",
        "body": "This is a great dress. It is cute, comfortable and flattering for most figures. The fabric is soft like flannel and stretchy like a super soft t-shirt while keeping its shape. It fits true to size and has a lot of give so the busty or not so busty girls look great, and you can stretch your arms out without feeling constricted. I gave it a spin dancing and the skirt twirl is fun. The ribbing in the fabric makes it slimming and the softness makes it cozy, but not sweaty hot. This fabulous dress lends itself to holiday party glam jewelry, or casual activities. It is well made, doesn't wrinkle easily and will DEFINITELY be a new GO TO dress. Read more",

I ordered the purple version, and it matches the photo. The pockets are great, and I can slip my cellphone into it without it falling out. It's easy to put on and take off. The length is just right (I'm 5'1\" and weigh 115 lbs), and it falls just below my knees. Its stretchiness is great and you can move around easily, but it retains its shape. The only downside for me is that the waist sits right across my middle tummy, and it makes me look pregnant, (I have a post menopausal tummy and a short torso) so, unfortunately, I had to return it. 😫 I highly recommend this sweater dress if you want a cute sweater dress!!
