        "body": "I wore this stunning red dress for my Jessica Rabbit costume, and I absolutely love it! As a plus-sized mama, I’ve always struggled to find outfits that fit well and make me feel confident, but this dress was a game changer. The fabric is stretchy and comfortable, hugging my curves in all the right ways without feeling too tight. It perfectly accentuated my shape while hiding areas I prefer to keep more discreet. The cut is flattering, with a slight flare at the bottom that made me feel both glamorous and comfortable. The vibrant red color popped and made me feel like I was truly channeling Jessica Rabbit, while still feeling like *me* in the best way possible. I received so many compliments all night, and I couldn’t be happier with how it made me look and feel. This dress is a must-have for any special occasion or costume event! Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a confident, flattering fit! Read more",

        "body": "I was so excited to try this dress and was hoping to wear it to a wedding in mid-September. However, I was a little disappointed with the quality. The dress felt thin but it's not see through because the inside is lined with a thin, soft, fleece-like material. When I put it on, it was comfortable and looked fantastic. The color and fit was exactly what I wanted, but I could picture myself sweating a ton in this dress because of that inside lining, especially if I'm tearing it up on the dance floor. Not sure what season this dress is supposed to be for, so I ultimately ended up returning it. If the initial look of it doesn't turn you off and you don't sweat much, this could be the dress for you.

        "body": "Dress was about 3 inches too short- or 3 inches too long. Where it hits was right at the ankle, which made it look like a mistake. Either it needed to be a little shorter to be calf length, or a little longer to graze the floor. Dress has darting to give the dress shape, but the excess darting material that is pinched and sewn is left inside the dress, which creates bulk in the material. The material is stretchy and nice, has a fuzz to the inside, seems either lined with the same material on the inside, or it is just a thick material. Either way, the feeling of the dress was nice and thick and even in neon \"green\" (looks more like a yellow) i couldn't see my tattoos through the dress. I needed about 2 inches of material cut out from the waist to fit my shape better. The top is fitting, but not necessarily flattering. Maybe larger darting would have helped for it to fit my shape better? Read more",

        "body": "I bought a pricey dress for a gala I had to attend but unfortunately it ended up not being very flattering, so I turned to Amazon for something comparable that would be here asap…my plan was to dress it up with lots of jewelry, staple pair of heels, and a nice bag- turns out the dress said enough and I didn’t have to overly compensate to make it look like more than an “cheap Amazon find”. I was worried about the straps because of some reviews but the straps on mine were just fine, not tearing. I ended up absolutely loving this dress and the fit! I was impressed and I’m so glad I grabbed this. I was able to sit comfortably and dance all night. The slit isn’t too high, I think it’s perfect, but it’s definitely a statement! It doesn’t breath super well, if you sweat easily you may get sweat marks, definitely glad our event was in a cold ballroom! I wouldn’t wear this in the super hot summer weather. I ordered the black, so I’m not sure if the other colors have the same material. Oh, and it definitely shows underwear lines so plan accordingly- seamless or nothing😬 For reference right now I’m 5’8 and 142 lbs. I lose and gain weight easily so my dress size ranges from 6-10 (medium-large) depending on where I’m at size-wise. Right now I’m more of a medium, I ordered the medium and I’m happy with this size! It fit like a glove and even had enough length to wear 3 inch heels. I will edit and upload a pic here when I get them (had a little too much fun in my dress and forgot to take pics so I need to get some from friends😅) Read more",

Cons: fabric felt cheap but was also lined in fleece? I don’t know what but it felt strange. The straps were thin and are that round knitted material, not fabric. The top also felt like a tube top and cut into my chest. The front seams were very weird, one went down the side and just stopped in the stomach. The other went all the way down to the slit.
