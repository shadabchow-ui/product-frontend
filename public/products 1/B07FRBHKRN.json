        "body": "I rarely write reviews because honestly I gave up on Amazon fashion along time ago because of fit and quality issues, I knew someone who had and couldn’t believe the fit and quality. I’m 55 years old 5’3 and curvy. I wear from a 14 to 18 depending on maker brands. I ordered XL in 5 colors great fabric and fits perfectly and so comfortable and stylish. The wrap at the waist makes me look smaller and hides the extra menopausal pooch. This is a great year around dress. I wish this company would make a v neck version with exterior block pockets and not side interior pockets and would be a perfect addition to buy more. All the colors have been vibrant and true to color. Read more",
