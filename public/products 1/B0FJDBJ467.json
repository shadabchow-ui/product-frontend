        "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars Flattering, Love The Feminine Ruffles, Made Well, Good Value",
        "body": "This dress is inherently flattering and fits well, presenting a very nice silhouette. I wear a U.S. size 22XL in most brands, but I ordered this dress in a 3XL, and it fits me nicely. (My chest is 42C and my natural waist is 41\"). I also really like the little ruffles, which make the dress look feminine, a quality that is always welcome in dresses for me. The dark brown color is rich and complements my skin tone beautifully; it works well with my medium light tan skin, dark brown eyes, and dark auburn hair with the thick natural whitish silver streak at the temple. The bodice looks pretty on me, though I am smaller in that area than a classic curvy woman would be. The chest area is very accommodating and leaves substantial room if you are bigger, as the material has a good amount of stretch to it. The long sleeves are excellent for fall and winter, providing arm coverage, though the fabric is not thick, so an outer layer or jacket will be essential for warmth outdoors in colder climates. The waist tie is incredibly versatile; you can tie it in the front as shown by the seller, tie it behind your back, or secure it at the sides, whichever you prefer. For my height of 5'5\", the dress falls perfectly about mid-shin, and it flows nicely when I walk. Regarding the pleats, they don't cling very much at all; however, if you have a larger midsection, the pleats may occasionally brush against your tummy as you move. This happens because the pleats require more fabric, giving the bottom a little heavier weight than a straight flared dress. Although I am keeping the dress as it still looks quite nice, I will say this slight movement against the tummy means the pleated look isn't my personal favorite, especially compared to my other non-pleated dresses that tend to flow away from the tummy area more easily. It's a well made dress, and there are no sewing mistakes, loose threads, tears, rips, or anything of the sort, which is excellent. Overall, this is a flattering dress with a rich color, accommodating fit, and I like the quality of the dress at the value. Read more",
