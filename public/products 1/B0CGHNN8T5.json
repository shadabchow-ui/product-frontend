For the price point, I was very impressed. The material was nice, good thickness and flowy, and the green color was very pretty. I loved that it has a clasp in the chest to show less cleavage if desired. The dress length was also perfect - above the knee but not too short.

It’s so versatile— you can dress it up with heeled boots for a more chic look or keep it classy with sandals for a more relaxed style. Anytime I need to dress up, this is my go-to dress. The quality is fantastic, and I love how flattering it is. I’m definitely planning to buy it in a couple of different colors. The only thing I had to adjust was the top, as I’m small-chested, and it showed a little too much for my comfort. But that was super simple to fix with a pin, and it worked perfectly. Overall, I highly recommend this dress if you're looking for something stylish, versatile, and comfortable. It’s a total win in my wardrobe! Read more",

The knee-length cut makes it appropriate for more formal occasions, like a funeral, but with the right accessories it can easily be dressed up for a night out. The fabric is lightweight and breathable, which makes it comfortable to wear all day. I love the zip closure for easy on and off, and the fabric tie around the back really flatters and accentuates the waist without feeling restrictive. The snap in the front at the chest also provides a flattering v-neck without feeling too revealing. The newest little black dress staple in my closet that’s both comfortable and classy!

To start, for reference I am 5ft 9in, I have long legs and sometimes struggle to find dresses that are an appropriate length while still being flattering. I weight about 170 and normally order a Large/xlarge. I got this in a large based on other reviews and pictures. 10/10 order the dress! This dress hit ALL my checkpoints. It was extremely flattering; the color and material is fantastic. It's well put together and doesn't feel like a \"cheaply\" made dress. They were thoughtful with the chest area; it has a snap to keep the cleavage classy and not trashy. The material isn't too thin or see through. The length hit perfectly for me. I got multiple compliments on the dress. I felt great with the way it fit my body as well. I got it in the pink and the light blue and am very much looking forward to the next time I can wear one of them!

However, the material was sheer, cheap, and would not unwrinkle even once it was steamed and ironed, which is super frustrating.

The fit was fine based on the size chart the part I wasn't expecting it has a wrap that you have to adjust but it worked fine I just didn't expected the wrap part. The washability held up fine but anytime I have stuff like this I always wash on delicate and hang dry. Read more",
