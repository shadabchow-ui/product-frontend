        "body": "omg! I normally dont do reviews but let me just say that it is SO hard to find dresses that fit me perfectly because of my size and petite build, but this dress... it honestly exceeded my expectations. I am 4'11 and weigh about 95lbs, and i got a size XS in black. this dress is SO flattering on me, hugs curves so well + its warm! I wasnt expecting it to be warm at all but I wore a shaw with mine and I actually didnt feel uncomfortable being outside in 50F weather. I could've even wore leggings underneath if I wanted to for extra warmth and it wouldve looked fine. the dress didnt scrunch up either when I sat down and got back up. the sleeves r the perfect length + they arent baggy and are fitted to my arms AND THE LENGTH!! omg the length was perfect, its something a very short person like me appreciates for sure! it hit about 1.5 inches above my ankle so I can still wear heels or even boots with it and it would look fine. and I feel like the dress stayed in place on my shoulders and didnt move that much compared to other off the shoulder dresses/tops (then again i didnt really need to lift my arms any and my shoulders are slightly more broader bc i workout) but obviously if you lift your arm up, the sleeve will ride up a bit and youll just have to slightly readjust. as far as the material, its not thick but its not thin, its a nice sweet spot if u want it to be somewhat breathable but still be able to wear it outside in cold weather. i am cold natured and this was fine for me in 50-60F weather + it wasnt sheer at all, its squat proof lol! and i will say, this dress is slightly over my budget, i would even agree that maybe $10 cheaper is appropriate BUT i honestly loved the quality and fit so much that i would buy it again. but overall, very pleased with this dress and will be getting it in the apricot colorway :) Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve Bodycon Formal Off Shoulder is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan.
