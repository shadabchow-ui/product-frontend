This can be a very dressy outfit with heels or a more casual dress. Material is good, slightly stretchy.It is not clingy.

        "body": "ROUGH FABRIC! Like old, double-knit polyester from the 70’s, without the benefit of being permanent press. The skin facing side is a smoother material, but a child will rub off a layer of skin if they hug you and bury their face in your legs. It’s also stiff and gapes weirdly when you raise your arms. Geez. It wrinkles and even though I hung it up damp, the wrinkles from shipping are still quite sharp. I wouldn’t want to iron this; I’m afraid it’d melt or get shiny before the wrinkles come out. And the top part feels like it’s made for a 2D person- lots of room in the front since it has bust darts (great for chestier ladies over 38D!) but no dimension in the back so it just feels oddly tight in back, loose in front. And there’s a weird off-center neck gap. I’m also 5’3” and the waist seam hits on my hips. Not a real surprise, but the belt isn’t going to work to hide it. Zipper is a little sticky and no pockets. But at least it actually showed up, and on time! yay. Pro: showed up, on time, good for taller, chestier ppl. Con: Sandpapery-like fabric, wrinkles, drape Read more",

        "body": "I love this dress! It would probably be tight in the chest if the wearer has large breasts, but it's perfect for me lol. I ordered based on my measurements and compared to the sizing guide and it fits perfect (a size up from what I thought I would need). The material has great quality and the zipper in the back is invisible but long enough I can step into it or put it on over my head. The spin is beautiful as well. The only thing that would make it even better is pockets! (No pockets). It hangs beautifully. I can't wait to wear this for family pics and attending a wedding! Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Formal Cocktail is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress Formal Cocktail is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Glitter_black, Glitter_burgundy, Mix Color, Black Blue White Flower, Royalblue, Blush Flower, Black, Champagne, Glitter_green, Darkgreen, Lavender, White Flower, Glitter_royalblue, Navy Flower. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
