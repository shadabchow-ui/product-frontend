        "body": "Cute dress, but the sizing and fit is not accurate. Size up! If you are going to buy. Not see through at all and super stretchy and comfortable/relaxed fit. In between thickness? Enough to keep you warm while wearing but not overly warm. Neutral color that fits with a variety of outfits which I like. No matter what the sizing is the collar is super loose fitting. And the sleeves can be too big/long in length. I bought two versions a Large and an extra large (the one I kept). The large (my usual size) was a few inches shorter in length. But the sleeves were the perfect length and form fitting look. Fits more like a medium/small, super tight and form fitting in an uncomfortable way. And the neck/collar part was too big and had a gap in the neck part while wearing. Only issue with the XL is the sleeves are too big? They could be smaller in size, they fall down easily over my hands. While not perfect it’s a cute dress! The stretchiness makes it great if you are plus/bigger size. And the balloon sleeves and dress flow are flattering. The waist has a cinched corset type look that makes you look snatched. And the fabric does a good job at hiding your tummy. I’d give it 4/5 stars because of the sizing issues and inconsistent fit. Price point is a bit high to be having those issues. Read more",

I am 5\"3' and 175~180 pounds and bought the XL. I don't have a big chest but I do have a broad back and this fits extremely well. The fabric has a slight stretch to it and is so nice and soft. I usually have a hard time with tops that button at the back of the neck but it was very roomy and comfortable, where closures like that normally make me feel like I'm being choked. Only thing is yes, it is very short, the bottom of the dress literally is aligned with the bottom of my butt lol. You'll definitely need leggings with this. But otherwise I really love this dress so so much.

I wouldn’t say the fabric is thick, but very good quality. It is not see through at all, and it does have a decent amount of weight to it. The dress is tailored PERFECTLY. the waist lands exactly where it’s supposed to, which is always hard to find, being a tall woman. I love the idea of a skort, so I did wear very short black shorts under this, along with black nylons. If you don’t wear something underneath and you bend over, you’re gonna flash someone. Lol. It IS short, but that was the whole reason I wanted it. I’d say it goes about 1/4 to 1/3 down my thigh. Overall I am so pleased with the dress, and basically got an entire NICE outfit for $30. You can’t beat that! Read more",
