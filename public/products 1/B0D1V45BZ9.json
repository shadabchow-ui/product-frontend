        "body": "Gorgeous, Comfortable & Perfect for Any Occasion! I was a little nervous ordering this dress online, but it completely exceeded my expectations! The lace embroidery and pocket is even prettier in person—it gives the dress such an elegant, feminine touch without feeling over the top. The adjustable straps are a huge plus because you can customize the fit to your body, and the pleated tiered design makes it flow beautifully when you walk. What I love most is how versatile it is. I’ve already worn it to a summer wedding with heels and a clutch, but it also works perfectly with sandals and a capped sleeve shirt for a more casual look. The fabric is lightweight and breathable, which makes it comfortable for all-day wear, yet it doesn’t feel cheap at all. Sizing was true to the chart, and the length is just right (I’m 5' 7\" tall for reference, and it hits me right at the ankles). I’ve received so many compliments already! If you’re looking for a flattering, stylish maxi dress that you can dress up or down, this is definitely worth it. I’m already considering getting it in another color! Read more",
