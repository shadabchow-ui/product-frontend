        "body": "I bought this caftan/wearable tent for my mum, who wanted something cool, light and oversized to wear after showering during the warmer months when her condo reaches scary-hot indoor temps. Unlike the issues other reviewers had regarding poor construction, the garment we received was sewn well and the buttons all securely attached, though we had to invest some time in removing stay threads, which wasn't unexpected. The fabric wasn't scratchy as some others reported, and it will likely soften over time. My mother is hoping it that it will also shrink. So many garments -- even those sold under major brand names -- are now made overseas, and in different locations (because it's always wise to diversify your supply chain), even if the manufacturers are creating the same style/model garments. As a result, sizing and quality can differ widely, and that's possibly the reason the quality of these garments is so all over the place. Anyone who's made repeat purchases of their favorite bras and knickers or other apparel has probably been disappointed in the huge quality and sizing difference from one repeat order to another. Kudos to those who shared photos where they made this otherwise shapeless garment look almost chic. My otherwise fashionable mum chose a lager size than she'd normally wear, so we had a good laugh at how it magically transformed her into a frumpy-dumpy matron. If only it had even a bit of an A-line cut instead of straight all the way from top to bottom, it might give it more movement at the hem and eliminate the ballooning effect in the midriff area. My mum is 5'5\" and the hem brushes the top of her feet. And the mid-section made her look like she'd instantly developed a man's very generous beer belly. Good for a giggle, but not exactly flattering. She's hoping a very hot wash will make it shrink a bit both in width and length, because she's decided to keep it as she'll only be wearing it in private, and it should at least be something cool to wear in the summer after a shower or a swim.

        "body": "Why did you pick this product vs others?: Positive reviews supported my decision to purchase this. I was not disappointed. I’m between a size 12 & 14. After reading it was quite oversized, I went with a medium. Although it fits, it’s more of a regular shirt dress than the relaxed look I wanted. It does get narrow around stomach and hip area, but it wasn’t all that full on top. It isn’t sheer, however, you can see the outline of your legs when the light hits. Overall, well made, good quality fabric, nice design, wonderful pockets and very well priced. May reorder another color in the large to achieve the right look Read more",

        "body": "Fabric is nice with a comfortable feel when wearing it. Stitching is well made. Good to wear during warm and hot months. Minimum wrinkling. The sleeves are a batwing type of sleeve (with a deep, low armhole) making a very loose fit at the armhole and gives space to the breast area. Sizing is difficult to guess. I’m 5’6” and length is good for me. I weigh 140 pounds with 34B bra size, bought medium size and I could have gone for the small size and still have a very loose fit so choose sizing according to the look you want to achieve. I was looking for a long shirt type of dress cut but the add photo or dress specifications doesn’t show or mention the batwing sleeves. You can always style it wearing a long necklace or a loose belt if you have from flat to minimum stomach. It will probably need light ironing after a cold water wash. Read more",
