        "body": "This dress and the fit was exactly what I was hoping for, and even exceeded expectations. But one surprise element to this dress that wasn't noted in the fabric content, which the garment description shows as 100% cotton, is that it has a light lining that's definitely synthetic. But the lining has a nice, silky feel, making this already comfortable dress slip on like a dream. In the front, the lining starts below the front bodice, at the gathered part of the dress, and in the back, it starts right under the neck yoke. I was worried that the lining would make this otherwise cotton dress a bit hot, especially on the back if you're sitting against something like a hot car seat for any length of time. But that's not the case. Even in almost 100-degree weather, the dress stayed cool. And the lining keeps the dress from being too sheer, so I'm glad it's there, even if it's not cotton. This is a pretty forgiving style, so I bought it in a size larger than I usually wear. I'm 5'5'', and it came just about a couple of inches below my knee, which is perfect for me. The fact that it drapes a bit better in the larger size actually makes it more flattering and slimming than if the fit at the top was a bit less loose. The dress is surprisingly well made, and the cotton fabric is soft, has great movement and is not at all stiff. Though having previously worked for years in women's apparel, I expect that certain fabric colors may have slightly different textures. And as is often the case with less expensive clothing, the quality of the fabric can change from garment to garment -- whether due to the dye colors used or changes in fabric sourcing -- even if it's the same make and style. So I'll be prepared for some variations when I order more, because I definitely want this dress in more colors. 7/13/24 UPDATE: It's been sweltering here in NorCal for the past couple of weeks, and this dress is all I want and can bear to wear in this heat. Even though the light lining isn't cotton, the dress is still cool and comfortable, and the lining allows the body of the dress to drape nicely. Just received delivery of my third of these dresses, and after wearing the previous two quite a bit, I really appreciate the light texture to the fabric, which keeps it from appearing wrinkled, even if you take an unplanned, heat-induced nap in it. Woke up and the dress was surprisingly unwrinkled! Oh, and now that I have it in three colors, I can report that the quality of the fabric and construction is consistent with each order. Also -- can't stress this enough -- buying it a bit oversized is actually more sliming than having it too tight over the bodice. And due to the slight drape of the lined body of the dress, it doesn't balloon out and make you look larger. Be brave and go big! Read more",

        "body": "I'm 5'4\", 150# and i'm happy to say that the medium fit very well. loose enough to be comfy and fitted enough to not look like a sack. the sleeves fit loosely without any constraining. I bought the black and green. The green was too sheer for me and i wasn't in love with the light shade of green. it looked less \"earthy\" than i'd hoped for. It wasn't super see thru but just enough when I checked it thru light --it would make me self-conscious of what else might be seen wearing it outside in the bright sunlight. if you don't mind some sheerness then it might work fine for you. anyway, i kept the black. it's super comfortable and looks very cute and casual. i like the pockets very much and the ties, while not really needed, add a nice whimsical touch to the dress. the fabric feels like the 100% cotton they state and the tag confirms it. i wanted a dress that would be simple and cool to put on for everyday in the summer heat. i do wish they had more colors like a deep purple. i might try the coral and/or yellow at some point. this would look great with leggings in the cooler months too!

        "body": "I love these dresses! I've ordered three of them now. They're so easy to just throw on with a pair of sandals and go when you want something light and cool to wear, but still want to look put together. I've worn them out running errands, to church, and get-togethers with friends. I've gotten compliments on them.😊 Looking for a dress with pockets? These have really big ones! I have one of the biggest phones on the market and it fits easily into one of the pockets and I can put my keys, sunglasses, etc., in the other. The only time I have issues with my phone falling out is if I am bending over to pick something up off the floor. Then, alas, gravity takes over.😉 The dresses are 100% cotton with a light polyester lining for the skirt. The way the dress is structured, the skirt barely skims me from the waist down, so the polyester lining doesn't feel heavy or hot to me, not even when I'm sitting down on it. The cotton material is light-weight with a really nice pattern woven into it. The pattern is more obvious in the lighter colors. Because it's not a knit like a t-shirt, there's no stretch to it. That's not a bad thing, it's just something to be aware of in case that's what you want. I really like the way this dress is tailored, more fitted through the bodice, though not tight, and then looser through the belly and hips, in case that's an area where you need a more forgiving fit, which I do. The 3/4 sleeves are also a looser fit through the upper arms, not tight at all, and then gathered in at bottom, enough to give a nice definition without being snug. I wash them on my washer's permanent press cycle on cold and hang them up to dry. I haven't noticed any shrinking or fading. I am 5'4\", wear a size 16XL, and am short-waisted. These all run true to size and come to my knee. Size and length have all been consistent in the three dresses that I ordered. I ordered three different colors. The black is a nice, deep black, which may not be the best choice on a really hot day while walking in the sun. The navy is on the lighter side, easily discernible from the black. The salmon I ordered because one reviewer said it was more of a rosy pink than a peachy color. Alas, mine was not, so just know that going in if you are hoping for a pink. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress V Neck is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",
