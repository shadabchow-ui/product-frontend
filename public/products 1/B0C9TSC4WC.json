        "body": "I bought this dress in the creamish-tan color and the darker brown, and I love them both. They are super comfortable, have a float flirty skirt, and are the perfect length. They seem well made, but the fabric is definitely a little bit sheer. The darker brown one hides undergarments better, but the lighter colored one shows everything, so be prepared to wear a slip or to wear nude colored underthings if you get that one. The dress does have pockets, which I find myself putting my hands into a lot, but I likely wouldn’t actually use them to carry anything because of how lightweight the fabric is and how it would end up pulling the dress down and making it look weird on one side. Overall, they are cute dresses and I have worn them each several times already, just plan for the sheerness! Read more",
