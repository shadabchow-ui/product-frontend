        "body": "Super cute and flattering dress! Wore to a wedding in the heat and humidity of Dallas in August and it was so comfortable yet elegant enough for the occasion. I am 5’3” and felt that it hit at an appropriate length, and the waist detail is so cute! Fabric wrinkles easily, but nothing some wrinkle release spray or iron/steamer can’t fix. Also love that it has pockets and was such a pretty color of purple! Tie for halter top felt secure, and I have washed and air dried this dress a couple of times without issue. Can’t wait to keep wearing this! Read more",
