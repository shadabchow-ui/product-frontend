        "body": "I bought this dress in 4 colors becuase its so cool, comfy and looks great. On days Im out in the field, I like wearing cool and comfortable dresses that I can wear with sneakers. This dress is that and more. The color is vibrant, it washes well and is very comfortable. The fit is loose and the length was just above the knee (Im 5'0). This versatile little dress can be dressed up or down. I wore it to a tailgate with boots and a hat and it looked great. I wore one of these with sandals and jewlry and it looked casual dressy. The material is light but a good quality. Not see through or flimsy. Read more",
