        "body": "I was really excited about this black off-the-shoulder dress—it looked so elegant and had that perfect mix of simple and stylish. The fabric was soft and surprisingly comfortable, with just enough stretch to feel easy to move in. The off-the-shoulder design stayed in place without slipping, and the dress had a flattering silhouette that hugged in the right places without feeling too tight. Unfortunately, while it looked great overall, the fit didn’t quite work for my body type. The top felt a little too loose on me, which made it sit awkwardly and didn’t give the polished look I was hoping for. For someone with a fuller bust or broader shoulders, it might be perfect, but I ended up returning it. Still, for the price, it felt like a quality piece, and I wouldn’t hesitate to try something else from the same line. Read more",
