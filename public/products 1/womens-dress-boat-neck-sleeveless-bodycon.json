Often dresses that look above the knee on models hit me at an unflattering length. But this one was perfect. I followed Amazon’s size suggestion and am glad I did. I was worried it might be too snug but it was perfect. I wore a light compression shaper under it just to keep everything really smooth—but the fabric is a nice, medium weight that holds its shape so wearing a shaper under it would be totally optional.

        "body": "I bought this for a funeral and it’s perfect. Everything about the dress is nice quality. I did end up buying the wrong size. I tried it on and realized it didn’t fit- didn’t take the tags off or anything and immediately went to go return it, so I could buy a size smaller in a timely manner. When returning it they asked me the usual questions: reason for returning, if the tags were still on, if it’s been worn. I answered those and they just told me to keep it and refunded me the money. So now I have two of the same dress in different sizes lol. Once getting the second dress in the correct size, I was extremely happy. It fits beautifully. It’s modest, but also cute. I highly recommend this. I am 5’7”, weigh 138lbs. Body measurements (in inches): B- 36, W- 31, H-37. Size Small is the one that ended up working for me. Read more",

        "body": "Bought this dress for a recent trip to Club Med for the \"white\" dress code night. It is adorable and very flattering. The fabric is a little thin, so I had to be careful to pick underwear that didn't show. A second layer would have been good, but for the price it's good. I am 5'1 and about 113 pounds and the small fit perfectly! Plan to buy another in black and maybe gray for spring. UPDATE: I bought the black and gray but had to return them. Black was much larger than the white and the gray was very wrinkled as if it had gotten wet and dried in the package. A few weeks later I ended up buying the black in XS. It was very cute! A little snug but looked good. Definitely seemed to be a thicker fabric than the white. Last week I bought the light blue (kind of a blue/gray) and decided to get the small since I wanted to wear it to work and didn't want it too tight. It is perfect! I definitely could have gotten the XS too but I love it. I have lost a few pounds and am now 5'1 and 110. I want to buy more colors!!! Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Boat Neck Sleeveless Bodycon is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",
