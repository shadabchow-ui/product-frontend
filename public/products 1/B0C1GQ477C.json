        "body": "I love this dress. The material is lightweight, soft and perfect for both summer and early fall. It has a really flattering fit that drapes nicely without clinging, and the neckline adds just enough detail to make it feel a little dressier. The length is great and the colors look exactly like the photos. It’s one of those easy throw-on dresses that still looks put together. I’ve already worn it to brunch, errands and even a casual date night. It washes well and doesn’t wrinkle easily, which is a huge bonus. Definitely one of my favorite pieces this season. Highly recommend. Read more",

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars You NEED this summer dress!",
        "body": "I bought this dress for a casual picnic style wedding. I knew I wanted a bold summer color, something lightweight so I wouldn't be sweating all afternoon. Most importantly, I wanted a dress to highlight my recent 40 pound weight loss, and my regained self confidence. I am 5 ft, now 152 lbs. As its been a very long time since I've been this weight, I was very unsure what size to order. And since I wear a 36DDD/F bra, that makes it even more difficult to find clothes that fit right. First I ordered a XL, which was much too large everywhere. But I knew this was the dress I wanted! I exchanged it for a Large, but it was still slightly too big, so I sent it back for a Medium, which thankfully was perfect! I have never minded showing off \"the girls\" and this dress allows just a touch of sexiness without being inappropriate. (NOTE- I did have to order a plunge style bra so the center wouldn't show in the small opening beneath the knot). The Rose Red color is beautiful, and must be the \"It\" color this summer! I actually saw many women wearing almost identical colors, or similar pinks! It was 80°, no shade at all where the ceremony was held, and the lightweight material kept me comfortable the whole time. It has a 2nd thin layer underneath, similar to a built in slip. It helps ensure comfort, but also helps prevents panty lines. The flowing sleeves give it a fun and flirty touch, making the dress very versatile. It can be worn for Ladies night, date night. I paired it with bright pink lace up sandals, and matching earrings, or the dress alone could be the focal point, worn with nude shoes, and simple jewelry. After struggling with my weight for years, this is the first time I've been able to dress up and feel good about myself. Being able to fit into a size Medium after wearing a 2XL for this long, and finding this gorgeous dress that looks so flattering, made me feel so confident. My only recommendation; I don't ever really iron, (I think I've probably ironed 2x in the last 8 years lol), but it couldn't have hurt. The dress arrived about 3 or 4 days before the wedding and I had it hanging in my closet until the day of. I definitely won't say that it wrinkles easily. It lasted the whole wedding without a single crease appearing. But I could have run a warm iron over it to get the wrinkles out from shipping, and I'll have to see how it looks after I wash and line dry it. I suspect it may require a quick iron to smooth it out. But well worth it for such a beautiful dress. Great quality for a great price. Sheer perfection. This is THE summer dress for any occasion! Do not hesitate to buy this. You won't regret it!

        "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars Cute style, but short with less coverage than expected",
        "body": "I really wanted to love this dress. The material and style were cute, but at 5 ft tall, the dress still fit quite short on me, which surprised me. The bigger issue for me was the lack of coverage in the cleavage area. It felt lower cut than I was comfortable with, especially for the event I planned to wear it to. Because of that, I ended up returning it. That said, this dress could work well for someone looking for a shorter, more revealing style or for casual wear.

  "short_description": "Womens Dress V Neck is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress V Neck is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: B Sky Blue, Brown, A Pink, Moss, Z Sky Blue, Ginger, Sea Green, Rose Red, Z Orange B, Parchment, Multicoloured C, Yellow Cream, Multicoloured B, Multicoloured E. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
