        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Nice Quality, Trendy Style but Short!",
        "body": "Upon opening this, my initial impression was that the material feels nice and I really like the color. The fabric is a chiffon-like, semi-sheer material that drapes in different areas, which makes it a little confusing at first to figure out how it’s meant to be worn with all of the ties and layered draping. One thing worth noting right away is that this is very short. I wouldn’t personally consider it a dress. It is more of a top or possibly a tunic. Because of the length, I think it works best styled with pants or worn over another skirt rather than on its own as a dress. This brand doesn’t provide a size chart, which makes ordering difficult. Without measurements, it’s hard to know what size to choose, and visually this does appear to run on the smaller side. I’ll be trying it on with pants to see how it looks styled as a top. One pleasant surprise was that it comes with a separate, detachable bangle that you can wear. I may have missed that detail in the listing, but I think it’s a really cute and thoughtful addition. At around $75, I do think the price is a bit high for what this is—especially considering it functions more like a chiffon top than a true dress. While the piece does look well made and feels like good quality, the short length means it requires additional styling to make it wearable, which affects the value for me. Overall, I like this brand and find their pieces trendy and cute, but I strongly feel they need to include a proper size chart. Their sizing can vary significantly depending on the item and who’s wearing it, and clearer measurements would make ordering much easier and more confident. Read more",

        "body": "Beautiful relaxed, mini dress perfect for vacation. You do have to mess with the tie across the back and the halter neck tie to get the correct fit. It took me a couple tries to figure it out but once I got it on absolutely beautiful; but at first I did have my doubts that it wasn’t going to fit me in a flattering way, trust the process and adjust it as you need to fit your body correctly. I really like that you can wear the gold bangle separately or add it to the dress. Personally, I really like the gold bangle added to the dress as a little something extra to it that gives it some more detail. I did stick to my normal size medium. I am 5’6 I wear a 34C bra size. Usually a 6-8 in jeans. I found this to fit me true to size which is like a loose relaxed dress, which is exactly what I wanted. Excellent value for the money I cannot wait to wear this on vacation. This looks and feels more expensive than it is. The quality is on par with the price. Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
