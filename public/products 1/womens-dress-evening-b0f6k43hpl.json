This red dress is an absolute showstopper The bold color commands attention without being too loud, and the fit is incredibly flattering it hugs in all the right places and still allows for movement and comfort. The fabric feels luxurious against the skin and has just the right amount of stretch. Whether you’re wearing it for a formal event or a romantic night out, this dress brings confidence and elegance. I received so many compliments, and I genuinely felt like the best-dressed person in the room. Highly recommend if you’re looking to turn heads Read more",

The top is super flappy and pretty sure a push up bra would not fix it. But when I say this dress *feels good*….i mean it. The fabric is thick like a super nice pair of sweatpants or super silky crew neck sweatshirt. I’d feel secure even if I weren’t wearing shapewear. Not see-through at all. But super heavy and maybe not a great summer dress. The hip details are insanely beautiful, evenly pleated, and so flattering. The front bodice is super slimming against the hip detail contrast. This won’t work for the event I need it for but I’m considering ordering a large just to try and keep it on hand if I end up loving it (which I think I might…) Read more",

Fourth, there is a slit in the leg, also not in the description and fifth and lastly, it was way past floor length, a lot of fabric dragging. I did not receive the dress I ordered at all, they were 2 completely different dresses. So, needless to say, i will be returning this immediately. — After returning the first dress and receiving the second as I really needed this dress and had to re-order it, I will say second time I did get the correct dress. The quality was very good definitely a heavier, material and thicker than expected but in a good way. I could honestly have seen myself enjoy enjoying this dress, however, for me, it did run a little large, so I have to return it again Read more",
