        "body": "08/2019 EDIT: I wrote my first review on this about two years ago and figured I should update and reword everything to make more sense. SIZING I currently wear a 34C 1/2 in thridlove bras. I wear a medium in these bralettes. Because they only come in S/M/L etc, it doesn't quite fit how I would like it to. The band part fits perfectly when I first put it on - snug but not too tight - but the 'cup' part of the bra is just the slightest bit too small. I've tried a large and the cup on those bras fits much more comfortably but the band is far too loose. The worst thing about these bras is how they stretch out. Throughout the day, the band gets substantially more loose which of course results in the bra having even less support. CK probably doesn't intend for you to wear them as a daily bra for 12 hrs, so if you only wear them as a lounge bra, then I'm sure it won't bother you much. Also, throughout the bra's lifetime, they get more and more loose and they hold their stretch for even less time. I'm not sure how much putting them in the dryer affects this, but I've stopped doing that on my newer ones and as far as I can tell, they are maintaining their elastic and shape. Bottom line: always wear this bra for a whole day or so before you decide if it's the right size. I'm a 34C and medium starts out a bit tight, then gradually turns into being a bit loose. The large starts out acceptable, then gradually turns into WAY too loose. AUTHENTICITY When I first bought this, I had also purchased one from Calvin Klein's website at the same time. At first, the Amazon and CK ones were noticeably different. I felt like the Amazon one was too large, especially the straps, and the CK one fit just right. I'm not sure what happened, but after wearing them both for a long time, I can't tell the difference anymore. Something that happens with these bras, which I'll go into later, is that they stretch out. The Amazon one felt almost as if the straps had been stretched out much more than the CK ones, or maybe they were just made incorrectly. I'm still not sure. My theory about these bras is that some or most of them are just slightly defective CK bras that they don't want to sell at their own stores. There could of course be other explanations, but this makes some sense to me considering the differences I saw in the two bras. Some of the differences I first noted actually weren't that different at all, like the seams and stitching being messy. The only real difference that still confuses me is that the printed tag on the back was placed differently. Bottom line: after ordering several and wearing them all for over a year, I can safely say that they are (at least for the most part) the exact same as the Calvin Klein bras. QUALITY These are pretty disappointing. As I noted earlier, they probably aren't meant to be a daily bra that you wear 12 hours at a time, which is exactly what I do with them, so take that into consideration. The ones that I bought two years ago, I can't even wear anymore. I couldn't really wear them after only one year. Over time, the elastic around the waistband gets so destroyed and stretched out that it doesn't hold shape when it's on your body and thus there's no support. I've been trying to keep them out of the dryer lately, because I suspect that that's what's ruining them but I'm not sure about it. I always cut off the tags so of course I don't know the care instructions anymore. Make sure to check before you wash them. Also be careful when removing the tags. They do remove completely so that there is no bit of tag leftover to scratch you, but you have to be very careful with the threads holding them down. One of mine ordered from Amazon got a hole in it where the tag was even though I'm very sure I didn't cut anywhere wrong. It might be my fault or it could be that the threads were sewn in incorrectly. Bottom line: only expect these to last about a year with regular wear. Side note: for as long as I’ve been wearing these, they have always gone on sale for black friday and the prices fluctuate regularly for each size and color. If the one you’re looking at is a little expensive, wait a week or two or just for black friday sales. Read more",

        "body": "I own a few of these now. They are excellent lounge around the house bralettes. Not the best support but thats not why I bought them. Im someone who feels more comfortable sleeping in a bra so I bought these for that purpose (underwire bras arent as comfy to sleep in) I buy size small my mesurements are Underbust - 30 inches Fullest over bust is 36 (sometimes 37) inches Around under armpits is 34 inches Im 5’8\" and 138 lbs. The small fits me super well. I do have complaints about the elastic as it stretches out quickly, not to a point where it doesnt work, just looks worn out quickly. The elastic is comfortable though. And I can always replace it if that times ever comes. The fabric used is super soft and lightweight. It covers the bust area well and is breathable so keeps me cool on hot days at home. Not very suportive but does hold the girls in well enough that I'm not hanging out or falling out of these. Goes over my head and shoulders with ease. Sometimes it rolls and gets stuck but thats usually after a shower and Im sticky and not fully dried off. Does not hide nipples poking through. Does not provide lift, but does give the feeling of being held without being too tight. Read more",

        "body": "Ok so I’m the first to be like “designer stuff is basically the same as Walmart” mostly because a lot of it is, but CK has had my heart for years. I bought the old version(because the material had absolutely changed; for the better imo) when I was a size 0 glamour model living in Cali after getting my first big check. Since then I’ve rebought this bra twice(replaced is the better word) the first after my first baby and the second now as a baby bodybuilder and loungewear lover. I am on the autism spectrum and cannot stand itchy fabrics, thick seams, or tags, so for those of you wondering yes this is sensory safe. I sleep naked and have for years but last night I fell asleep in this and honestly I don’t want to take it off. It’s buttery smooth, fits exactly to my body, and if it’s anything like the one I had will last for years(which means more colors for me!) universally flattering(it’s really hard to look bad in Calvin’s imo) classic and comfortable, plus wearable on its own or under clothes. I have d cups and I’d say it’s a reasonable amount of support for comfort wear, but size down if you would like more. Also side note if it’s cutting into your back fat/shoulders you need to size up(a lot of us wear the wrong size) For reference I am 5’2”, 132 lbs, 34D, 28 inch waist, 38 inch hips/rear(for those wanting to order the panties that go with this bra ☺️) I’m wearing a size large for comfort I but would size down for more support Get it, I promise you’ll wear it all the time. No more Victoria secret for meeee Read more",
