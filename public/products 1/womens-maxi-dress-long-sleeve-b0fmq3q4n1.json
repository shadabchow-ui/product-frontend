It is well made and feels like it is nice quality--this is not light and thin at all. Very nice. The design is cute and the sleeves were the perfect length for me where most are too long. The cuff part fits really well on my sleeve and is not too tight or loose and goes back into place without stretching out. I can also push up the sleeves too. I like that it hits me about mid thigh for both the look and it makes it warmer. It is also a bit stretchy. I really like this sweater and I only with it had pockets. Read more",

        "body": "I really wanted to love this, and if it actually looked like it does in the display image, I would be giving it 5 stars. As it is, I feel 3 stars is pretty generous. What I do love about it is the fabric itself. It is incredibly soft, and very heavy. The weave is very fine, which makes it quite warm and cozy. It really feels amazing. The sizing runs on the small size, however. I ordered the largest size, 2XL, and although I am by no means a slender gal. The 2XL fits a LOT more snugly than it should, as you can see in my pics of me wearing it. I also think pockets would have been a wonderful addition. The deal-breaker, however, is the deer. The ones in their picture look great. In the sweater I actually received, they look utterly RIDICULOUS! It's like they just literally stretched it out for the larger size! They are totally deformed, AND, the head is buried in the armpit! And this is true of both the front AND the back! In fact, there is not even an entire head showing on either side! You can see in my picture of the side-seam, the two heads(the front and back, literally have their faces overlapping in the seam. All that really shows is is the extremely deformed backend! I personally do not want my bust decorated by the a** end of a deer! Perhaps the smaller sizes do not have this issue, or I just got a really bad one, but because of this design flaw, I can never wear this in public. Such a shame, as everything e,se about it is truly top-notch. Read more",

The reindeer on the sweater do not fully show on ANY part of the sweater like the pictures. The heads are oddly sewn into the side seams and the only consistent part of the reindeers that can be seen is the rear end on both front and back. They obviously were skimping on the sweater material and rather than position the reindeer like the photo or matching up the print on the side seams. There was zer attempt to match up the rest of print. It's a supposedly long sleeve sweater with ridiculously short sleeves (we even ordered up) that depictes only 🦌 deer rear parts front and back (as their heads are sewn into the side seams) and horribly noticeable mismatched patterns in both side seams. This sweater is a terrible mess that was pur together in an incredibly sloppy way. WE DO NOT RECCOMEND! THIS SWEATER IS A MESS! DO NOT BUY! Read more",
