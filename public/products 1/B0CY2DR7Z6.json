        "body": "This dress is ADORABLE! I am usually a large but I purchased the medium just to see how the fit would be. It’s almost too small in the bust, yet I’m fine with that because it hold the girls in place. The fabric does not have any stretch. The only place is where the elastic is in the little back hole. You can keep it pulled down or up depending on what look you’re going for. The dress is soft, it’s almost like a “wrinkle resistant button down” shirt material, if you know what I mean. It almost feels like it is water resistant. The pockets are perfectly placed where it doesn’t look like they are there. The patterns and colors are so cute. I actually want to get one in a large, just because of the bust in the medium. I’m a 38C, 5’7” and I’m between an 8/10 size, for reference. Plus, I just want another one because I love it so much, and the bust in the medium kind of gives the uniboob sports bra look since there is NO ROOM and no stretch. Another girl had the same dress in a different color at the event I was going to wear this one to. I decided to go with a different dress because of the top fit situation, and when I pulled the back down it gave me a little back fat pouch. I would have to just keep it closed if I wear it. Maybe pin it up? But the back is SO CUTE and makes the dress so I’m just going to get another. Buy it!! Read more",

        "body": "Super cute dress, the color is just as advertised. I love how it looks but I unfortunately will be returning. The design of the dress is super flattering however the pressure it puts on your chest due to its cut makes me uncomfortable (as someone who has sensory issues). It’s a good thickness and provides support and there’s no need for a bra! If the pressure doesn’t bother you I would highly recommend this dress. Not see through, cute back and length. I am 5’3” got a XS and it hits my ankles. I wish I could keep it but I know it would sit in my closet because I feel overwhelmed when I wear it. Read more",

        "body": "EDIT: So, I actually ended up re-ordering this in a different color as I needed a cute summer dress, but just accepted to myself it's polyester. Well, imagine my surprise when the one that showed up is... I am 95% sure... actual cotton! Well, the lining is polyester for sure. But I was shocked that the fabric itself was different. That explains all the raving comments about the fabric! Not sure if it varies from color to color or from batch to batch. The black stripes on white at least was, for me, a cotton one (mostly, anyway). The light blue stripes on white was not! All very weird. But basically, buyer, be aware! This is such a shame. The dress itself is super cute and flattering, but as soon as I touched it I knew it wasn't cotton. The lining was without a shadow of a doubt polyester, and the dress itself was 98% certain in my mind to be polyester. Of course, you don't expect the highest quality dress for this price, but it isn't like cotton is a luxury material these days and it is well within the realm of what you might find a genuine cotton dress for. Well, the fabric itself had several loose threads hanging off it, so there is a very easy test for whether or not this is cotton or polyester - i snipped one of the threads and set it alight - DISCO! It shrunk and melted immediately with a smell of burning plastic. At this point, I thought I would try to source the original design, which is Petal and Pub and maybe try to buy that one, even at 2-3 times the price. However, even the reviews ofthat one aren't the greatest, so back to the drawing board. If you know what you are getting - a cute, fast-fashion polyster dress that may last a couple of seasons if you are lucky - then this isn't a bad buy. But I am returning it because I can't abide the lies. Read more",

        "body": "I love this dress! I think it’s super comfortable and it’s a great dress for this price point. It has a small open on the back which helps keep it cooler during the hot months. I think it’s very versatile as it goes well with a navy jacket, beige and even a denim jacket if it gets chilly. It does wrinkle but honestly I don’t really care as much for that. The dress itself is thick so not see through at all. If there were other very different patterns I would have gotten them. Also my favorite feature: it has pockets! Its not too tight on the chest. I love it! Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Maxi is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",

This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size.

It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan.
