        "body": "The medium fits me well. The only con is the armpits are a bit large and the waist may need a little pull in but it’s just barely off. I think this dress fits pretty well. I think I’d have preferred a small but I think the small would have been tight on the bottom half and that’s not what I want. The color is beautiful and the fabric is so soft and the flower pattern is fuzzy to the touch. This dress is totally worth it and I plan to buy more in the future!!! This dress is a soft mesh on the arms and outer layer and a soft polyester spandex blend in the inner layer this dress is modest and flattering and that’s why I love it. Read more",

It hugs in all the right places and has a very flattering shape—especially the sleeves and the fitted waist. The floral texture gives it a classy, elevated look that makes it perfect for dinners, parties, or even holiday events. I ended up returning it only because the fit wasn’t exactly what I needed for the occasion, but the quality itself was great. If you want a dress that looks elegant while still being comfortable to move in, this is definitely a good option! Cons: ✖️ Fit can vary depending on body type (size up if between sizes) Read more",
