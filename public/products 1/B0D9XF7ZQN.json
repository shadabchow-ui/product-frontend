        "body": "The media could not be loaded. The dress was really nice particularly when I first put it on. I did notice that it looked a little funny because I was short for reference. I am 4’11 to 5’10 and unfortunately, when I first put it on it just kinda looked a little funny on me, but after a while, I paired it with some heels and it did come out very nice. I liked the fabric of the dress. It feels a little soft and silky not too harsh kind of like what you would think shape wear would feel like and I absolutely love square cut out so obviously that was a bigger plus for me. Overall, the dress is pretty nice if you want something cute and simple. I say get it. It is a bit basic for my taste, but I believe that you could spice this thing up with some styling and make it whatever you want it to be honestly to mention the weight of the dress it was actually pretty light, not too heavy at all and then it isn’t see-through at all so you wouldn’t have to worry about that Read more",

It’s stylish enough to look cute in photos but also practical enough to handle a full day of activity.

        "body": "5’ 7”, Purchased an XL, 200lbs, Pear Shaped Pros Fabric: I wore this on a date and it allowed for a good amount of expansion as I was eating without feeling overly constricted. The fabric provided good coverage, it was soft and stretchy. Neckline; Square necklines are very flattering and it creates a great highlight for the décolletage. ***If you are interested in layering, the neckline would also suit a button down underneath or another shirt for extra visual appeal/ styling. Since it is a very simplistic dress, you fancy also dress up the look easily with a pair of heels, perhaps a blazer/sweater and great accessories. Style: A line dresses provide a very universal look that looks great with so many different body types. The A line allows for the bottom half of the dress to glide across the thigh without appearing snug. Cons Length: I am 5’7” with a pear shaped physique, short waisted, have long legs and a large derrière. Due to this, the length was much too short in the back and the waist was a little too long since I am so short waisted. ***I loved the length in the front so I just added a longer cardigan to deal with the lack of length in the back. You can certainly pair it with a cardigan or blazer (fitted or oversized) Sizing: Although I love the stretchiness of the fabric, I feel like the bodice area around the midsection is smaller than the rest of the bodice. Although there is some forgiveness for the stomach due to the ruching in the fabric, the tightness around the midsection left a bit to be desired. I was able to move the ruching around to not make it so obvious but it was just ok. I actually sized up for this dress and it still felt like the bust area was bigger than the area around the midsection. Read more",
