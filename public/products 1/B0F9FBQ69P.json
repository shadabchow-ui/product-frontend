        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Wrapped in Fall Elegance—And Yes, There Are Pockets!",
        "body": "Elegant, comfy, and surprisingly pocketed—this dress is a fall favorite! 🍂👗 I bought the Dokotoo Women’s 2025 Fall Wrap V-Neck Long Sleeve Empire Waist Dress for a cozy-yet-polished autumn look, and it totally delivered. It’s like the dress version of a warm hug with a side of sass. 🌟 What I Loved: • Flattering Fit: The empire waist and wrap V-neck combo gave me shape without clinging. It’s flowy in all the right places and cinched where it counts. • Soft & Stretchy Fabric: It’s made of a viscose-polyamide blend with a touch of elastane, so it moves with you—not against you. Perfect for dancing at weddings or reaching for cookies at brunch. • Surprise Pockets! I didn’t expect them, but they’re there—and they’re deep enough for a phone or a snack. Instant bonus points. • Versatile Style: I wore it with boots and a chunky necklace for a fall festival, then swapped in heels and earrings for a dinner date. It’s a chameleon in dress form. • Color & Drape: The fabric has a subtle sheen and drapes beautifully. I got compliments from strangers and one very fashionable llama (long story). 🧵 Sizing Tip: I’m usually a US size 8 and went with a Medium—fit like a dream. Check the size chart, though, because the empire waist means the bust fit matters more than usual. 🦋 Final Verdict: Whether you’re headed to a pumpkin patch, a party, or just want to feel like the main character in a rom-com set in Vermont, this dress is a winner. It’s elegant without being fussy, and comfy without looking casual. Highly recommend! Read more",

        "body": "Not for high-waisted or busty women. Really. I'm serious. I looked like I gained at least 10 pounds just putting it on. So why 2 stars? It's soft and seemed well-made. I size up for a fitted bust and did that here. Because the style and cut are the problem, I gave them the benefit of the doubt that a tall, thin person might look better. Usually, a belt or a safety pin can pull the dress in if necessary because the picture looked like the waist would hit at a natural high waist. It did not. The waistband was just below the bust. The point of the \"V\" was approximately 2 inches from the top of the waistband... I couldn't tell if it was an illusion though. I did try to pull it down to see if it would stretch in the right place, but that just made the V lower so that didn't work either. So that was it for this one. I took this dress off as fast as I could at that point and then tried on one of my old dresses to make sure I hadn't actually gained weight. (All good, so there will be no picture of me in this dress - ever.) Good luck with sighs of envy to my tall, thin friends. The length of thr dress and the length of thr sleeves was good. Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Red, Brown, Pink, Purple, Apricot, Black, Navy Blue, Green. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
