        "body": "Ok y’all, I’m crazy and bought two different colors and three different sizes. So if you’re debating, this is the review for you!! This sweater dress is beautiful. Very soft and super comfortable!! It’s definitely oversized. Size down if you want a more fitted look but if you’re looking for the oversized cute and comfy look, go with your original size. I’m 5’2, about 195lbs and this XL dress fit beautifully for an oversized look. The sleeves were so long they went over my fingertips but I can pull them up to look nice and the length is right above my knees. It’s very comfy and could be comfortable as a Christmas movie watching, couch day or dressed up for a party or pictures. I would buy again! For color reference the one packaged on the right is the beige color and the one on the left is the white color of this same sweater dress. The white does have a tad light yellow shade which is super disappointing, as I got this to match my daughter’s first Christmas sweater. Read more",

It is really pretty, but in my opinion, it does not look like the thick, sturdy, chunky, Irish knit sweater in the image. If you’re looking for a lighter, nicely machine knit sweater, this one is perfect. I did not open the package so I can’t comment on what it feels or fits like. I could tell through the clear packaging it had a slight shine and looks soft. It was nice but not what I personally looking for. Hope this helps someone. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Brown, Cherry, Deep Green, Blue, Red Pink, Rust Orange, Apricot, Opal, Deep Gray, Black, Red, Navy, Wine Red, Khaki. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
