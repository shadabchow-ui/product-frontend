I've worn it twice, to 2 very different types of events, with very different vibes, and I received a ton of compliments at both.

        "body": "This dress is stunning. I own this in the brick red and a year later I ordered the medium blue. I tried on the navy as well and it's beautiful but definitely felt more formal (which wasn't what I needed). Every single time I wear it I am given compliments - it really flatters an hourglass figure (even if you have a bigger bottom). It doesn't wrinkle easily, has a nice stretchy but isn't too thin or thick. Two things: It comes with a clasp to hold the front together, and I love that, but I preferred it a bit more modest so I crossed it further and added one stitch higher up and it hid easily in the seam. 2nd: the sleeves are a little long, so again I folded them under and added a tiny stitch on either side of the wrist to hold them in place. Absolutely worth it for how comfortable and versatile this dress is. I used a microstitch gun (tons on Amazon) to do it while I had it on :). 10/10 recommend. I wish I could have it in ever color.
