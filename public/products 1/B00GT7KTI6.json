I will be pairing it w fleece lined off black tights and tall 3.5 inch black pointed boots.

        "body": "This is a great dress, especially for the price. I ordered the wine color, and it is a lovely darker red (my favorite!) It is much heavier than I expected. Not thick, just a heavy knit - it literally feels weighty when you hold it, but doesn't feel heavy when wearing. The ribbed knit is very form-fitting and shows every curve, which was what I was going for. Falls a few inches above the knee, which I also like. Great with leggings, tights, or none of the above! The cowl neck required a little adjustment and washing to get it to slump the way I like, but no complaints really. Warm, comfy, and sexy. Highly recommend, as long as you are comfortable with body-hugging dresses. Read more",

The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Wine, Brown, Jadeblue, Dark Grey, Black, Coffee, Lightgrey, Softgrass, Orange, Baby Blue, Plum, Green 2, Morandi Pink, Lakeblue. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
