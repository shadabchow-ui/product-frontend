        "body": "I bought this black dress for a wedding, and it was absolutely perfect. The fit was true to size, super flattering, and comfortable enough to wear all night. The fabric has a nice weight and flow to it, it looks way more expensive than it is. I loved how versatile it felt simple enough to style different ways, but classy and timeless for an event. I received several compliments, and it photographed beautifully too. Pros: elegant fit, comfortable fabric, perfect for weddings or formal events Cons: just make sure to steam it before wearing for the best look Read more",

Was not made for my body type (6ft/36B/29”waist/40”hips) and had construction issues. Pros: fabric color and feel is actually pretty nice Cons: the bust construction is strange, the gathering is placed very close to the center so will not accommodate most body types; not cut on the bias so the stretch is weird over the hips and gaps at waist; would be maxi maybe up to 5’8”; mine came with a tear where the bodice joins the skirt by the zipper, so quality and longevity is a concern. Overall I probably would suggest someone try this dress, i image it would be very pretty on the right body type! Only concern is the quality as mine came already damaged, which i took an additional star off for. Read more",

The fit was just right—not too tight, not too loose—and the length made it easy to move and dance gracefully without any fuss. I did have to get it altered- I’m short 5ft so it’s expected. The material had that perfect silk-like feel—soft, smooth, and just the right thickness so nothing showed through. There’s not much stretch, but the fit was spot-on so I didn’t need it. It looked and felt so elegant, and I honestly felt amazing in it. For the price, the quality completely exceeded my expectations. It felt way more expensive than it was—definitely great value for money. I’d 100% buy this again in another color! Read more",
