        "body": "The mailman JUST delivered this dress, and I love it! Definitely a 5 star review! As you can see from the photo, I was totally unadorned and unmade up (it was 10 am, and I'm retired!), but wanted to try it on right away to see if I'd keep it. The first thing I noticed was that the fabric is substantial and heavy, which is great for the cold months. Then I noticed how long it is! The sleeves are very long, and I have long arms. I slipped it over my head (no zippers or hooks necessary), and felt how nice and stretchy and COMFORTABLE it is. And the length is great. I am 5'8\" and am used to things not being long enough, but this dress is certainly not one of them. I weigh 160, and I ordered a L, and it's a perfect fit. This will be my Christmas dress, and I can't recommend it more highly for all the things I've mentioned. Read more",

I have large breasts (34 I) and it is always very hard for me to find dresses with this type of top that don’t scoop too low. This dress fits in all the right places and I will not have to worry about the top moving. I got an XL I am kinda surprised at how it hugs I would have thought it would be looser but it works perfect. I am taller than the average woman but not by much the the length hits right above my ankles. It will work for any winter event or wedding!
