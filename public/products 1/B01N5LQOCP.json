I didn't even need to use the zipper to get it on or off. The seams line up a little oddly against my body's natural proportions. (Perhaps I could have gone down a size to a 1X?) The sleeves fit well, not too snug but secure. The front hem came down juuust below my knees and the back hem just below my calves. The fabric itself felt soft and smooth. It also had a 'quality weight' feeling to it and was not 'thin looking' when held up against the light. (The deeper color may have helped with this.) There were a few loose threads that didn't simply 'pull away' and will need trimmed or affixed. The royal blue color was a little darker than I expected - less 'Bright Blue' as shown and a little more 'Bright Navy'. Read more",

        "body": "Needed a dress for a formal event and Amazon rarely disappoints. This dress was very classy, simple, and well made. I love the high-low hem which allowed for good air-flow on a warm evening, but also gave a nice shape. The fabric is on the thicker side. I thought with the A-line waist I could get away with a bikini undie, but because of the heavy drape, I didn't do that. The off the shoulder style is really pretty and flattering; however, if you raise your arms up too high (like fiddling with your hair, or giving hugs) you will have to readjust the hem line throughout the night. I also liked that I don't have to worry about deodorant stains with the way the sleeves are--such an odd bonus to highlight, but a bonus nonetheless! Read more",

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nicely made and I understand the mixed size reviews.",
        "body": "I ordered this dress at the last minute, a little nervously since lots of reviews were mixed on sizing up or down. I decided to size down to a medium. Given my 5' 2\" 160lbs. pear shape (36-32-43), I felt like a large might be on the long side and I usually don't like the high/low hem style to begin with. It wasn't my first choice because of reviews and the hem style, but needed a dressy option that would arrive on time and could pass as a prom outfit for my wedding anniversary/prom night at WDW-Epcot (checking off \"drinking around the world\" and redoing \"prom night\" from our bucket list). What I wanted was ease of movement, comfort and a dressy but understated style. Also, since Central Florida in November is still warm but can get cool by night fall, the material had to be able to meet the weather conditions without me having to drag a jacket around the park. When I received the dress, I immediately noticed the color was a bit off to me. I wanted the navy blue and when I checked my order, I realized that I had ordered the purplish-blue instead. Despite my disappointment, the color was still very nice, so I decided to try it on and it was so close to navy blue that I didn't mind it at all. All this to say that it's more blue than purple if that's important to you. I initially tried it on with a bra and it was a cute fit, cinched my waist and the sleeve didn't feel tight or constricting. It has a nice medium weight to it so material wise it didn't feel heavy or itchy. It has a little give in the arms, but it was just a bit snug in the middle (around the ribs and tummy), however that worked in my favor because I was going to use a shaper and realized I didn't have to (my upper mommy tummy was being held in by the dress)! The high end of the hem hit just at the knee (on the model it hits her mid/upper thigh), so I was hoping for just above the knee, but I've accepted my shortness, so I half expected this. Other observations: it's zippered in the back and helps shape the upper part of the dress. The top of the dress and skirted part are sewn together, so on me the banded seam sits just below the belly button. I would also consider the band is about 1 1/2 inches wide (where the zipper stops and flares out into the skirt part). I'm mentioning this because in bright light I noticed my whole tummy wasn't completely held in, but it wasn't that noticeable to affect my review and the flare is forgiving in that area. The day of, I slipped it on and zipped it up without my bra and found that the girls were secure (I'm a B cup and still perky in the chesticles post 3 babies) so I decided to go braless after asking my hubby if he could tell whether or not I was wearing one. I wore a heeled sneaker with it and managed to pull off a classy look and still be comfy! I think it would be super cute belted, but all the belts I looked at wouldn't have arrived on time and definitely will do that the next time I wear it. Overall I checked off most of my \"wants\" and I may order a different color in large. Although it was a great fit, the snug waist means there's no room for the days when my body holds a bit of extra water weight, which is at least true for me. My suggestion is to order your true size AND a size down then decide for yourself the best fit. It is a 50/50 shot, but I was pleasantly surprised and understand the reviews a bit better now that I tried it! We received many compliments that day and I felt great in it! Read more",
