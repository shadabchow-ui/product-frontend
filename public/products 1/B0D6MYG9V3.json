        "body": "I absolutely adore this v-neck sweater vest dress. It’s one of those pieces that instantly makes your outfit look chic and put together, and there are SO many ways to style it. Fit & Sizing (I’m 125 lbs — ordered a Medium): I ordered the medium and it fits with that perfectly oversized, relaxed vibe. I probably could have gone with a small, but I actually like it slightly bigger—it gives that cozy, effortless look. The knit is soft, comfortable, and not clingy at all. And the pockets? A major plus. Styling Options: This dress is a layering superstar. Some of my favorite ways to wear it: Over a bodysuit With a turtleneck Layered with a crisp white blouse Paired with boots Wrapped with a belt for a more defined silhouette Or left loose for that casual-chic vibe Every version looks adorable and polished. Color & Pattern: I ordered the pink houndstooth, and I’ve never gotten so many compliments. It’s fun, stylish, and a little unexpected. Occasions: Perfect for work, brunch, school, travel days, shopping trips, or just a cozy yet pulled-together outfit. Bottom Line: Cute, comfy, flattering, and incredibly versatile. If you want a piece that you can dress up, layer, or wear casually, this sweater vest dress is a total win. Read more",

        "body": "I wish I could give this dress 5 stars because it’s very cute and comfortable, feels like it’s made from a high quality fabric, and is a perfect dress for Fall. It’s probably not thick enough to be worn in the winter months, but it’s a cute dress to wear to work, so if you’re just going to be exposed to the winter elements going to and from your car, I would probably wear it during the winter.😊 The one thing that made me take the 5 star rating away was the pockets on the dress. The dress itself is an oversized fit, making it flattering for all body types. BUT this is a dress that really didn’t need the pockets, especially placed on the sides where they tend to hang open, really taking away from the look of the dress. No one needs side pockets added to the sides of their hips, no matter what size they are. It’s unfortunate because this dress comes in some really cute patterns. If only they would remove those pockets……. Read more",
