        "body": "5'2\", 140 lbs, 36DD. I ordered the sz L in Green and it's beautiful and fits me well. The shade of Green is Emerald. The drawstring at the hips allows for a low back drape or you can cinch it up. I am short waisted and so I needed to wear it higher in order my panties not show. The tube-top part is very stretchy BUT it barely came around to cover the sides of my boobs. Since the fabric is thin, I wore silicone nipple covers which were amazing. The halter tie is of attached thin straps so you can use them or tuck them in and go strapless. Because I'm short, I knew I'd need to shrink the dress after trying it on out of the bag. It's made of Rayon which will shrink up after a wash but easily comes back to size with steaming. I choose to put my dress in the dryer after the water wash and it shrank enough to wear with flats and still graze the floor. Had I not washed and dried the dress, it would have been too long to not drag on me (5'2\") and I don't think heels would have been enough. I ordered the sz L to prepare for the length shrinkage. I got so many compliments on this dress that I've ordered other colors. I'm a huge Free People clothing fan and this 'dupe is an amazing dupe. Read more",

For sizing, I got the XL and I think it is still a bit on the small side for me, but was the largest size offered. For reference I am 5'6\", 230 lbs, waist 40, hips 46. Specifically tight in the breast area. I wear 38C. Waist is easy to fit because there's a tie in the back for the waist that I cinched up fairly well so don't worry too much about that part fitting. It's definitely adjustable. Read more",

        "body": "I absolutely adore this dress. First off, I didn't think the 36Ds would have enough fabric, but they did. It's not the most flattering dress for me, it hits a bit above my waist which annoys me. 5'9\" and it was long enough to tuck up in to my belt for a little breeze. It's so light and flowy and magical, I just love it and how I feel in it. I also have a wide low-back scar, and the ties adjusted enough so it wouldn't dip super low and show. It'd probably be cuter if it was let down just a bit in the back. Be aware that it's pretty see-through, because I was not, and spent an entire day at the Medieval Faire basically with my high beams out in the right light, but.... 🤷‍♀️ Worth it lol. Seems to be great quality and I was nice and cool in the 90* weather. My fiancé didn't notice it was a little sheer (indoor lighting before I left), but loves it and said it's a keeper lol. In the future I may pair it with a lace tube top or some nip covers, but.... It's not offensively obvious in black. If I got any lighter color, I'd absolutely have a decency issue. You can see the green of the trees through the skirt in a couple photos, so you'd see the pink of my ladies in a lighter shade for sure 😂😂. I thought about this one for like over a year before giving it a chance... If you have prime imo go for it. OH, and it smelled a little like black dye (vinegar - ish) at first, but aired out fine and I sprayed perfume. Read more",

        "body": "This dress is SO CUTE with great length. I was a little nervous because it looks shorter (above ankle length) on some of the models and review photos, but it did dust the floor when I was barefoot, so I was happy about that. The color looks great, but my only gripe there is that the color leached a little after a wash and when attempting to steam out the persistent wrinkles this fabric holds on to. My gripes are little, and overall I really liked the fit and the look. It was comfortable, flown, and flattering. I'd even buy this in more colors. I love that it can be a very casual summer dress, but you're able to dress it up too! Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Brown, Apricot, Army Green, Black, Orange, Aquablue, Plum#1, Lavender, Beige, Brightgreen, Royal Blue, Mauve, Turquoise, Dusty Purple. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
