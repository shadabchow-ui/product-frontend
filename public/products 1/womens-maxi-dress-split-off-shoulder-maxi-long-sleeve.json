        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing!! Perfect for family photos!",
        "body": "I purchased this dress in the brown color for fall family photos on the beach. I bought the XS and typically wear XS or S. It fit great and the bottom was so flowy and beautiful. The color is a deep rich brown and there is an inner liner so it’s not see through at all even with the sun shining behind me in photos. I actually decided to cut the stitching that connected the sleeves to the rest of the dress so it was a sleeveless and strapless dress for photos and this was relatively easy to do without cutting the rest of the dress. If I was doing photos at home in Indiana I would have definitely kept the sleeves but wanted something more beachy! This dress is very versatile, I can wear it with a sweater on top for fall and winter and it’ll look like a maxi skirt. Overall I am so pleased with this purchase and will be ordering other colors for sure! Read more",

The fit is incredibly flattering thanks to the smocked high waist, and the off-shoulder design gives it a sexy but still classy look. The side split adds just the right amount of flair without being too much. The long sleeves balance the dress perfectly, making it great for both warmer and cooler weather. The fabric is soft, comfortable, and flows beautifully when you move. I felt confident and comfortable wearing it all day. This dress works great for so many occasions—date night, vacation, brunch, or even a casual event when dressed up with heels and accessories. It looks even better in person and fits true to size. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a boho-chic dress that’s both stylish and comfortable! Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Split Off Shoulder Maxi Long Sleeve is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Rust, Cherry, Fuchsia, Rose, Light Yellow, Coffee, Orange, Dark Green, Light Blue, Olive, Navy, Pink, White, Dark Black. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
