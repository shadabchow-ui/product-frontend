        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Just WOW!",
        "body": "LOVE. THIS. DRESS! Good quality fabric and construction, and a very flattering and forgiving fit. The ruching drapes beautifully and the one-shoulder design is done so well. One-shoulder and off-the-shoulder look is so popular this year, but I've found that the fabrics are too stiff and the look just doesn't work. The minute I put this on, I knew it was a winner. It hugs my shoulders (which are pretty wide) very well and doesn't fall too low on the \"off\" shoulder. The neckline is just lovely. I always wear a \"medium\" in the Prettygarden brand and although some reviewers said it runs big, I did order the medium and am very pleased with the fit. I'm 5/8\", 140 lbs and I think if I'd downsized to the small, it might go from looking elegant to a little bit trashy. The length in the medium ends up right at my ankles for a \"tea length\" look. I ordered the Rust Red and the color is very true to what you see onscreen, but I'm exchanging it for the Army Green which appears to be a nice neutral green (rather than an army \"olive drab.\") I'll be dressing it it up with strappy gold sandals, simple gold jewelry a gold clutch and plan to make a glamorous entrance as stepmom-of-the-bride at an October wedding. Waste no time, shoppers! Order this dress today. It's a great style for an unbelievably great price! Read more",

        "body": "Love! So stretchy and fit my 20 week pregnancy bump. The ruching around the waist allowed my baby bump to fit in the dress perfectly. I purchased size medium to ensure the length would be long enough with the bump and it was great. Very comfortable dress. I was never uncomfortable in it. Only issue is because it’s very tight around the waist (although extremely comfortable) you can see panty lines. I’m assuming if I wore it in a different color, you’d not be able to wear underwear. For around $30, this was an incredible purchase for the price! Definitely will consider buying again in another color. And I love that I can wear it again while not pregnant because this dress was not a maternity dress but was extremely accommodating of a baby bump. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Formal Cocktail Sleeveless Maxi Ruched One Shoulder is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",

Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters.
