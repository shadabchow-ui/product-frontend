        "body": "Let me start off by saying this dress was comfortable and cute! I wore this for my cousin’s wedding party and no one could have guessed that I got it from Amazon. Very elegant and showed off my curves! I am 5’6” and 205 lbs and I got a Large. It fit me perfectly. I do have to say that I am 2 months postpartum and did wear spanx in this picture and you can’t even tell! The material is thick and well made. This dress does not have pockets. I believe it functioned well for the event I wore it for. My only complaint is that the slit of the dress was a little high and I pinned it so my thigh wasn’t fully showing and so my spanx didn’t show. Overall I loved the dress and I received a lot of compliments on it. Everyone assumed I bought it from a fashion website and paid a lot of money for it. I also like that it comes in different colors as well so I can buy another for any occasion. I’d recommend buying this for any formal occasion. Read more",

        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good",
        "body": "All the reviews are true. Wear this dress, and you'll get a ton of compliments. It was comfortable, looked great, and was just about the perfect wife of the father of the bride dress. I needed something that fit amazingly well, floor length, nice enough that I looked like I belonged with the father of the bride, but not so fancy I looked like I was trying to upstage more important people. This dress fit the bill nicely. My biggest headache with the dress was getting the creases from shipping out of it. I tried hanging it to let them fall out (it hung for two months and still had creases), getting it wet and hanging to dry, washing and drying on permanent press (it held up to that great, but it didn't fix the creases), and ironing on my iron's synthetic setting. I finally gave up the day before the wedding and took it to a dry cleaner - they worked some magic and get the wrinkles out of the dress. Another annoyance I had with the dress that I didn't see mentioned in other reviews is that it did not stay put. I lost count of how many times I had to adjust it over the course of the evening. It didn't really ride up, but it kept twisting so that the right side seam was about 4-6 inches rotated toward the front of the dress. It still looked okay from the front, but the center seam down the back looked weird curving off the right. So I had to keep grabbing both side seams and yanking it back around into the proper position. Thankfully it was an adjustment that was quick and not one I needed privacy for, but it would have been nice to not have to keep doing that! The fit was pretty much as I expected. I ordered a small and medium and ended up choosing the medium. It is form-fitting and stretches over your hips. The small was just a little too tight over my hips, but fit my top half better. The medium for nicely in the hips and was a little large up top, but not bad. The arm holes were a little big at the underarm, so my bra peeked out just the tiniest bit, but was barely noticeable with the nude color bra. I wore 2.5 inch heels and the dress was for length but not dragging on the ground. The slit came to mid thigh and did not at all feel inappropriate, especially with the ruffle covering the top of it. I wore Spanx shorts underneath, and only about half an inch peaked out at the top of the slit if you looked for it under the ruffle. I'm 5'7\"and 133 pounds, 34C. I had some trouble figuring out how to accessorize this dress, but I found that a fancy pin at the top of the ruffle really added some interest and took the dress up a level. I added a coordinating necklace and called it good. Read more",

The color is that beautiful, rich royal blue. It's fairly stretchy, which is always a positive for fit. but in the thinner side as some have mentioned. I would have preferred just a teeny extra weight/thickness to it for sturdiness and longevity of wear/tear. Overall the silhouette was lovely. Wearing it felt okay, good movement to the material, hugs curves nicely. But the tummy part just didn't do it for me as it did for others. Other, vary similar dresses seem to be a better fit for my frame. I want to say the dress runs a little bit of anything size wise.
