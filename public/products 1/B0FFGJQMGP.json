Im wearing it to a very fancy wedding with blk boots, adding a beautiful beaded necklace & bracelet with lots of color. This dress is exactly what I had hoped it would be. Im 73 yrs young and this absolutely fits my style. I did order a x large first thinking it would run small, it was huge and just too much, I will be sending it back. Reordered in a size large and its perfect in every way. I will dress it up for the upcoming wedding, and dress down for dinner out with sandals. Im 5'4 150 lbs. The price & quality of this dress more than passed my expectations. I will order in the Army green as well. Read more",

This dress received several compliments when I wore it with riding boots and a jean jacket. REAL pockets are a huge perk. I am 5’2”, 115lbs and ordered a medium. Sizing was perfect and the length hit me at my ankles. My ONLY thing with this dress is that there is a slit on each side, not just one. More of a personal adjustment than a problem, though!
