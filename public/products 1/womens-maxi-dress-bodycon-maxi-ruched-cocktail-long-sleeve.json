        "body": "I loved this dress for the style and the fabric. If you are on the taller side the dress will not be as long. But it also allows it to be worn with sneakers and more casual type shoes for a night out on vacation or casual event. Then you can wear it with some killer heels and go red carpet. The size small for me felt a bit large compared to how most of these 'body con\" styles tend to fit. That was great for comfort, but if you like a more extreme body hugging look, you can try going down a size unless you are very curvy. If you are a size XS or a 0-2 you can still wear the size Small which is what I did. It will still look so chic, and it will still flatter and give a feminine shape and still be a bit more forgiving in the thigh and stomach areas. the Fabric is on the thin side and while it's incredibly soft you may want to wear something that doesn't show panty lines, better yet a good seamless slip short. I would have given it 5 stars if it was cut just a tiny bit closer to the body. The dress is very stretchy so a bit less material would have allowed it to accommodate more body types. Read more",

This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Darkgreen, Wine, Brown, Hazeblue, Rust, Apricot, Black. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
