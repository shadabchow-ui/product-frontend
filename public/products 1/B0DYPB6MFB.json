        "body": "This is the first Amazon mishap that I have EVER had which has not led to an enjoyable resolution or experience whatsoever. My daughter ordered this product on a Tuesday for an event she had on a Saturday. It came in on a Thursday and was delivered in the color apricot even though she ordered it in black. She double checked her order to make sure she did not order the apricot color by accident and she did not, she ordered black. Additionally, the dress also came snagged (shown in photo) She spent over 1.5 hours on the phone with Customer service in which they were not able to help her in any way besides emailing a QR code for return. They said nothing would be able to be delivered to her before Saturday and then rudely suggested “why don’t you just look for something you want at a local store”. Besides the fact that this was rude, not everyone lives in a city with access to a mall, shopping center, or general clothing stores without driving several hours to the nearest large city. She also can’t drop her other obligations, such as work, to do so. On another note, as far as the apricot color is concerned, it is see through (which I know it clarifies in the description but some reviews had said that theirs came in and weren’t see through), the material has a rather rough and scratchy feel to it, but it was sent in the correct size, does have stretch to it, and fit as she would have liked if it had only been the correct color. Overall, very disappointed. The incorrect item was delivered, it came damaged, and the customer service experience was unfortunate. I would give this item and seller/brand 0 stars if I could.
