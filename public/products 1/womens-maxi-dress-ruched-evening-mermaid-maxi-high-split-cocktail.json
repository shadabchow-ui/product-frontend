        "body": "Couldn’t love this dress anymore! It is more of a thicker material. Dress offers ruching in the tummy area for those of us that could use a bit of “enhancing”. The ruffles stand & lay nicely. Not flimsy. It is a mermaid fit. I’m in between a medium/large. I did order this dress in both a large & an XL based on reviews. I opted for a not so slim fitting look and went with the XL. I can pull the dress off and in without having to unzip it being that I sized up. For the taller/longer leg girlies, I am 5’5.5” (longer torso and shorter legs) & the dress hits approx 1” above my foot. Def not floor length. Super cute with kitten heels. Ruled out regular heels due to where the dress hits on me. Would def buy again in other colors. Read more",

Everyone I looked at, I would look at actual photos in review of people that ordered them. This was the ONLY dress that had women of all sizes showing their photo review in comments and looked classy and flattering on EVERY single woman!! As soon as it came in, I tried it on and it was perfect! I didn’t have to have it altered at all.Almost like it was tailored for your specific body type. The fabric was a thicker material, but never once did I get hot in it. I would 10,000 percent recommend this dress for anyone all shapes and sizes. The thinkness of the material hides and imperfections you might have.Oh and it was super super cozy!! I’m a 5,7 145 pounds and bought a large. This the the only pic of the dress I have right now. I’m the one on the left and of course I’m setting down, but you can get a small glimps of it. Read more",

It was true to size and fit like a glove with a little extra room. The material was soft and stretchy. It looked amazing on me. I wore it to my daughter's wedding and received so many compliments. I'm so glad I found this dress! Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Ruched Evening Mermaid Maxi High Split Cocktail is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",

This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size.

A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory.
