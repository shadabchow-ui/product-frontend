        "body": "I wish I loved this dress. The material is nice (as non-natural textiles go) and the color is beautiful. But the waist is really like an empire waist, and I wanted it to fall lower, like the pictures show. It also has 2 weird spots on the bust where they used a 2-sided tape to literally tape down the inside flap of the neckline (a real dressmaker would never do this). That makes 2 weird puckers on either side of the neckline, and the fabric is very unforgiving, so it is very obvious. I am returning this. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Dress Cocktail is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",
