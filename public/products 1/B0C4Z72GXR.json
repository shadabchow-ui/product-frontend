        "body": "This is a classy faux wrap dress made of soft material with pockets. The material has lines in it and it is not clingy or stacky like some reviews say. The pockets are also not adding pounds as others reviewed either and they are good. The belt is flattering tied in front or back. I like that it is a faux wrap dress as I don’t have to worry about it opening. The chest wrap part is fine but I might pin it as it could be more revealing if you are conscious of that which I am. It seems feminine and pretty and could be used for many occasions like a party, work, casual day out depending on accessories. I like that it is long sleeve too even for warmer months as you don’t have do a cardigan over it running into air conditioning etc. The beige and the white are not see thru on me either as others said. I got a few colors and of course the black which can be a solid go to with accessories for an event or just dinner out. Seems like a versatile dress and I would try one for sure. It also runs TTS. Would be nice for anyone really of any size as it seems well made and classic lines . Read more",

        "body": "I ordered the Newshows Women’s Oversized Sweater Dress in Army Green (XL) thinking it would be the perfect cozy-yet-stylish winter outfit, but unfortunately it just didn’t work out for me. The pictures online made it look thicker and more structured than it really is. In person the fabric felt a bit flimsy and didn’t drape the way I expected. The fit was also off; it ran a little awkward through the shoulders and sleeves, and the overall silhouette wasn’t as flattering as I’d hoped. While I liked the idea of the pockets and the casual ribbed knit, the execution didn’t live up to my expectations. In the end I had to return it. It might work better for someone who wants a very lightweight, oversized style, but for me it just wasn’t the cozy, polished sweater dress I was looking for. Read more",

This dress accentuates the all the good. Makes the chest and waist look great, but flares in just the right spot, so it doesn't hug any of my abdomen. It looks best if I wear a bra that gives them a little umph, but then I do have to pin it if I where to work. I bought the color that's like autumn brown and accent it with a wide brown belt of a similar shade, a gold necklace and gold bangles. I wear flat brown knee high boots with it. The outfit makes me feel great and I often get complimented. It also is comfortable, good quality and has a perfect thickness for fall or early winter. Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory.
