Like others said, the armholes are big, I did have to them it in, I hand sewed them by overlapping the sequins (by hand needle & thread) and you never noticed it. This dress is a bit stretchy so was nice. I bought a large & a xlg and kept the lg as it fit perfectly because of it stretching. Read more",

        "body": "This dress is sized well (as in accurate to the measurements listed), but I'm not in love with the fit. It's a bit looser than I was anticipating and isn't super flattering for my body type, in my opinion. For reference, my measurements are 38DD (in US sizing), 155 lbs, bust 39-40\", and hips 43\". I'm usually a size XL and decided to go with the XL size for this dress, as the hips for the XL size was listed as 42.9\" and the bust was listed as 40.9. I was worried I wouldn't fit into the L. After trying this dress on, I would be concerned about sizing down because I had to do some pulling and tugging to get the dress over my bust and into place (only for it to look loose once on). The dress appears to be made well - I haven't had any issues with the sequins falling off. I did feel like I needed to be very careful putting on the dress and taking it off, but that would be the case with any dress like this. It's also not very comfortable to wear, but again, I feel like this would be the same with similar dresses. I ordered this for a New Years Eve party and I may still end up wearing it, but I'm definitely going to have to think on it. If you're familiar with sequin dresses, it may be worth a shot, but if you are someone who is sensitive to how clothes feel on your skin, you may want to look for a dress than doesn't have sequins. Leaving this at 4 stars because my dislike of the feeling of sequins is a personal thing, but I still feel like the fit could have been better and more flattering. Read more",

        "body": "The media could not be loaded. This dress is a higher quality and nicer design than I would have expected for the price. The sequins used are large and round, which means they reflect the lights or the movement of the lights over the dress (see the cool shimmer in the attached video for how it looks under moving lights). It is surprisingly high quality, with the sequins being well affixed. It is lined and the construction of the dress is good, with solid seaming and a good basic 20's flapper cut. It's surprisingly light in weight, so easy to wear and quite comfortable. I am 5'5\" and 155 lbs with a size 42 DD chest area and the dress fit me perfectly. I have underarm boobs spillage and I was worried that this dress would not cover it, but in my case it was perfect coverage. I think a lot of whether or not the armholes will work for you has to do with the kind of bra you are wearing. My bras are always tight enough that I can tuck that side spillage into my bra if need be. Overall, surprisingly high quality dress for the money. And it certainly makes a fun statement. Read more",

        "body": "The sparkle on this dress can be seen from a mile away. It is truly a showstopper. It’s such a fun, sassy, festive look and I can already picture it for New Year’s Eve, holiday parties, or even a Christmas event. I love the mix of large and small sequins because it gives the dress dimension and shine without looking cheap. The gold color is stunning, especially against my skin tone, so I’m really glad I chose it over other available colors. My only complaint is that the fit is a bit boxy. I wish it had more stretch or came in a smaller size, because I’d prefer it to be a little more fitted to show my shape. As it is, the straight cut makes me look wider than I am, so I may take it to a seamstress to bring it in on the sides. One thing to note: the sequins do catch on hair, so this is definitely a “hair up” kind of dress if you don’t want tangles or snags all night. It also has that slightly “crispy” feel most sequin dresses have, and I did lose a few sequins while trying it on but nothing noticeable. On the upside, the dress isn’t heavy at all. It has the look of a full glam sequin dress without feeling like you’re wearing armor. Overall, it’s a great value for the price as it’s flashy, fun, and perfect for a big night out, just be prepared for a few sequins to shed and maybe a trip to the tailor if you want a more defined silhouette.

And you can definitely travel with this dress without having to fuss too much with it. It will not wrinkle. And it hangs beautifully on the body. I did find that the armholes are very generous, which can be a plus for some of us, and can be a minus for some of us, too. I think this dress is great, and it is certainly worth a try.
