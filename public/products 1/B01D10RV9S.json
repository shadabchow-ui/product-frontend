        "body": "I ordered this dress for a Wednesday Addams costume for Halloween and was pleasantly surprised at the top notch quality of it. The material is 95% cotton/5% spandex. It’s extremely soft, stretchy and comfortable - and an absolutely perfect thickness. It has a nice zipper on the back with a button at the top. The collar is the exact amount of pointy and the black and white colors look excellent. This is one of the best dresses I’ve gotten on Amazon. It’s lovely and looks beautiful not just for Halloween, but also for going out on a date or to dinner with friends. It’s also just the right length - not too short and not too long. I’m 5’7” and 145lbs with a 36C chest. I ordered a Large according to the online sizing chart, but it was a bit too baggy in the waist and chest, and the sleeves were too long. I ended up exchanging it for a Medium which fits wonderfully. I would absolutely recommend. Read more",

        "body": "I bought his this dress to wear for Halloween with the hopes that I could maybe wear it outside of Halloween as well on the occasion without it looking too costumey. The dress arrived earlier than expected, which I was pleased about. It fit about as I expected. I usually wear about a size 4- size 6 in a dress, so the small fit about as I expected it to. I am about 5’4” so the dress was about knee length. I looked like Wednesday Addams. The fabric was slightly flimsy, but I usually like my fabric to be a bit thicker than this dress was, but it wasn’t too bad for the price. I would recommend this item for someone to buy. The dress looked nicely made. It looked like I had went to some trouble to find a specific dress with a Peter Pan collar and not like I went and just found some poorly constructed Wednesday Addams costume that I would spend $14.88 on for bad fabric and sewing. I did not want to do that. No offense to anyone who does want to do that. This is something that I’m hoping to work into my wardrobe even outside of Halloween. Even though the fabric is almost t-shirt-like, I think this could be something that I will want to try wearing every now and then. It is really just a nice dress. Maybe I’ll buy another color.

It's also way warmer than the polyester nonsense. The fabric of the dress was a nice thickness and I could zip it up myself without a problem, though someone else did the button for me. I'm 5'3 and 145lbs, the medium fit just fine with room for a tank top underneath. The only negative I guess is that the sleeves are slightly short. I saw other reviews mention color bleed. I tried the soak someone suggested and washed it with cold water and didn't have any bleed into the collar 👍 Read more",
