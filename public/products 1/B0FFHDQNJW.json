        "body": "I took a chance on this dress... I thought the extra layer that wraps and ties right below your waist might make me look bottom-heavy or add unwanted bulk to my lower abdomen and hips, and the knot would ruin the side silhouette. But it's not bad-looking if you tie it in a square knot so it lies relatively flat. The gathered fabric at the hips still creates some bulky ripples and wrinkles, and the odd waist seam almost creates the illusion of having a little side roll. I'm not quite sure why it was designed this way; it would have looked better if it were fitted at the waist, but flat and smooth. I love the stretchiness of the fabric, which is why I decided to go for it. The 90% viscose, 10% elastane drapes and hugs the body beautifully without feeling tight, and is so comfortable to move in. I'm a gym rat, so I like anything that feels as comfortable as my gym clothes. The fabric is the best part of the dress! I wish it came in an XS, as it's just kind of loose on me in general, even though I almost always wear a small. The top part and the sleeves look a little sloppy, like it can't decide if it wants to be loose or fitted, but thankfully, the bottom is more fitted, so it saves the look. Maybe it's just the style. For reference, I'm 5'1\", 115 lbs., 35\" chest, 26\" waist, 34.5\" hips, athletic build. I'm in my mid-late 50s, or \"pushin' 60\" as my husband likes to remind me. 😂 After over 32 years together, we can laugh about it! This is a very stylish yet not revealing dress, which I like, as I'm not into attracting attention. It's a beautiful dress for a casual date night with the hubby. Read more",
