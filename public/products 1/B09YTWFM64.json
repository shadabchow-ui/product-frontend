        "body": "I bought this dress for a fall wedding, and it was perfect. The one-shoulder design is super sleek, and the ruching is flattering without feeling overdone. It hugs your curves in all the right places, and the fabric has a nice stretch to it. It's not too thin, but not heavy either. The material feels high quality and breathable. The slit is not too high adds just the right amount of drama for a formal event, and the overall look is very elegant with a hint of sexy. I also love the bow on the shoulder. It's subtle but gives some extra detail on the dress. That said, it’s a bit form-fitting, so if you’re looking for something with a little more breathing room, this might not be the one. I ordered my typical size and it was okay but I also wore light shapewear to keep things smooth. Read more",

The material is soft, stretchy, and very comfortable while still looking elegant. The one-shoulder design and side slit give it a classy, feminine look, and the style is incredibly flattering on curves. I did need a small alteration in the neckline because it ran a bit big for me, but once adjusted, the fit was perfect — like a custom-made dress. I received so many compliments throughout the night and felt beautiful and confident wearing it. If you’re looking for a dress that’s sleek, comfortable, and great for weddings, parties, or photos, this is an amazing choice. I would absolutely buy it again in another color! Read more",

        "body": "Love love love this dress. I went to a very extravagant black tie wedding in Manhattan and ordered a few dresses from Amazon as well some super expensive high end dresses from Nordstrom in the $500 range. This dress was by far the favorite. It's so chic, elegant. flattering, and comfortable. Excellent length too (I'm 5'5\" and wore 3\" heels). I got the dark blue in M (140 lbs, size 6-8 usually) and it was gorgeous, like a peacock blue. A great dupe for a designer version of a very similar dress by Dress the Population. Fabric is thicker, but not too thick. Thick enough to hide bumps and rolls and offered excellent rouching. The bow is beautiful. I received many compliments on the dress and felt like it was definitely chic enough for this super fancy wedding. Cannot beat it for the price! Read more",

I will be doing some small alterations, but that’s just so I can make it hug my form more in certain areas. I am 5’9” and the length is just right for me to wear heels or flats which I love. The only thing I don’t like is that the tag is exposed by the slit, so I will be cutting that off so it’s not standing out. I will be wearing this to a garden party themed wedding and think it’s the perfect find for attending a wedding and keeping in my wardrobe for future events. Highly recommend! Read more",

Color is exactly what I was looking for, compared to others that I had tried. Thickness is just enough and it's also just loose enough that I don't feel the need to wear shape wear. And for being folded up in a soft bag for delivery, the wrinkles aren't really bad, light steam will help smooth them out easily. All-in-all this is a great dress, I will probably be buying another one in a different color. Read more",

        "body": "Ordered this on a massive time crunch for a gala I was performing in. I was very committed to wearing hot pink, but I was having trouble finding a gala-appropriate maternity dress; everything was either too casual or just straight-up tacky and not my style at all. A bunch of other reviews said this dress provides enough stretch for second trimester baby bumps, so I ordered a size up just to be safe since I had just entered my third trimester at the time of ordering it. Color was absolutely perfect and the shoulder bow adds a nice touch. The dress fit great around my bump and was super comfortable. It was a bit too big up top, but I ordered a 14 when I normally would’ve gotten a 10 or 12 so I was halfway expecting it to not be a perfect fit anyway. If you aren’t ordering up a size it should fit nicely all around. Be warned that it WILL show your panty lines through the butt so if you’re able to wear a thong, that would work best for this dress. It also arrived pretty wrinkled, so I had to steam it before my event. It is a bit longer than the picture makes it look, but for me that could be because of ordering up a couple sizes and the length didn’t make much of a difference in the overall look and vibe, it was still very pretty. Definitely wouldn’t recommend doing what I did and only ordering it for a single event only to never be worn again, because it’s a bit pricey for that. But if you happen to be pregnant and you have a lot of events to go to and you’re just not feeling any of the maternity formal dresses out there, this is a pretty good one despite not being made specifically for maternity.
