I saw so many mixed reviews from \"this is so cute and a great dress\" to \"it looks cheap, don't get it\". I took a chance in trusting the good reviews and I wish I didn't bother. I planned to wear this dress for new years eve. Upon opening the package, I noticed that the color was a more pinky red that a deep red. Taking it out of the package was more disappointing when I noticed how cheap looking the material was. I mean, this dress looks like a shiny gym legging kind of fabric. It made me look and feel cheap. Which was the total opposite of what I was going for. I gave this dress two stares because the cut of the dress was spot on. If it was a different material and the correct color, I think this would be an amazing dress. The off the shoulder ribbon tie would of been extremely cute if this material was good. Also, if you do have a lil tummy to show, this dress shows it all plus more!! I wanted to post a picture of me wearing it but honestly I was embarrassed to even show you guys, that's how bad this dress material was. I say for $40 don't waste your time or money on this dress. You can find something way better! Read more",

  "about_this_item": "Womens Maxi Dress Boat Neck Long Sleeve Cocktail is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.",
