        "body": "I purchased this dress in a size XL. This off-shoulder sequin gown was the perfect choice for the occasion—elegant, comfortable, and eye-catching. The rose gold shimmer added just the right amount of glam, and the design beautifully complemented my shape. The fit was great overall, though it was a tad loose in the chest area. However, that didn’t take away from how confident and classy I felt wearing it. The puff sleeves and draped front detail added a touch of modern sophistication, while the floor-length cut gave it a graceful, flowing look. If you’re looking for a statement piece that’s both flattering and comfortable, this dress is definitely worth it! Read more",

        "body": "I got roped into going to the Emmy Awards and needed a dress. I am not a dress person, so there was no way I was going shopping in regular stores. Enter Amazon. I waited until the week before to buy the dress (again, not a dress person!) and didn’t have high hopes, being short (5’3) and apple-shaped. Honestly, though, it looked great! And people aren’t lying about the compliments you’ll receive. I even had someone yell from across the street that my dress was gorgeous! Now, the nitty-gritty: it was way too long for me, but 3-inch platforms made it manageable but still a bit too long. I normally wear a 2X/20W but ordered a 3X, and it fit perfectly. Besides dresses, I also have no time for strapless bras, so I just let my bra straps slide down, and it was fine. I’m not super busty (42C) and that was fine as well. I’m adding the only two photos I have of the dress in full length, and one is from a little spinning video they took, so the quality isn’t great. I definitely recommend it, though. It’s comfortable, flattering, and looks a heck of a lot more expensive than it is. Read more",
