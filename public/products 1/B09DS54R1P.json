        "body": "I bought an XL to wear to my graduation. Normally I do wear an XL — I am 5’8 220 — however I could have probably worn a L. I have this in another color in a L actually! I would say the sizing runs a little large, but very comfortable and adjustable due to the waist ribbon. Another thing to note is it is quite short, especially if you carry more weight on your lower half. There is no bending over in this dress! Otherwise it is very cute and very nice quality material. I have worn it many times besides the one event. It’s very versatile, you can easily dress it up and down! Read more",

The fabric is light weight and not cheaply made. It is of good quality and has a slight stretch. I like a more snug fit which is why I wanted to try both Medium & Large. The style of arms and lower part of the dress were flattering on both the medium and large. The medium fit well on my arms and It covered the mommy pouch. The medium is a more snug fit on my breast for obvious reasons. I personally did not want my breast to be lifted out of the dress so I tried the large. It was a much better fit however, it still did not work for me. It was my personal preference to not wear the dress because I wanted to dress on the modest side. It is a beautiful dress and I would still recommend it. I would say that this dress is true to size. Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Brown, Gray, Y_geometry and Leaf, Z_19 Bk, Burgundy, Z_21 Burgundy, Z_25 Army Green, Army Green, Black, Camel, Z_28 Light Purple, Z_22 Dark Green, Dark Green, Navy.
