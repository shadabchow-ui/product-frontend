        "body": "I am quite picky when it comes to clothes, shoes and purses. I normally go shopping in person so I can look at quality, fabric, the sewing technique/design, the feel of it’s fabric against my skin (cheap materials tend to get me itchy and irritated), but due to COVID , I started Shopping for clothes online including Amazon. I’ve bought about 12 dresses within the last 2 years from Express, H&M, Nordstrom, Macys and Amazon and this simple but cute dress is by far the best purchased I’ve made online!! The Material, the stitching, design, the fit and feel from neck to arms to knees , this dress is great! Hides big tummies when you’ve eaten too much and back fats and big arms . True to size. I fit 4/6 woman’s (depends on maker the maker) and I’m a small , the small is not tight nor loose. It’sjust perfect!! Very flattering and flirtatious in an elegant yet simple way. Skirt part swings when walking …. Love love love this dress!! I literally bought more with different colors.. TRUST ME y Read more",

        "body": "This dress was incredibly flattering and I got lots of compliments. The 3/4 sleeves, somewhat fitted top, cinched waistline, and knee length flowy skirt complimented my shape. Although the material seemed nice quality overall and I loved the slight stretch, the white top was a little bit see thru and showed my bra lines. I bought this for a business event. Initially I was worried about it, and couldn't tell if it was super cute or made me look like a waitress? I planned to return it, but brought it with me out of town as a backup dress just in case.

  "short_description": "Womens Dress is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.",
