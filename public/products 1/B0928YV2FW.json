        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Wicked cute! But faded and pilled after wearing once.",
        "body": "UPDATE-6/1/24. Sadly after wearing this dress once to work, which that day was to my office, sitting at my desk… parts of the skirt, around the belly area started to pill and fade wicked bad. I haven’t washed it yet, So I’m not sure why or how this could happen. I love this dress so much, I’m really hoping this is a defect. I did put in for an exchange so Amazon will be sending me a replacement. I will give the company/seller the benefit of the doubt and will leave my review at 4 stars until after I receive my new dress and wear it to see if the same thing happens. I was planning on buying more from this company but I think I will hold off for now. If this is a common problem then that means the quality of the fabric is not great.. so we will see what happens. I provided pictures of pilling and fading. It sort of hard to see without zooming in or seeing in person. If this happens after wearing once, I can only imagine what this will look like after washing and wearing a few times. I think I paid $34 for this, to me, that’s expensive for poor quality. ************************************************ I bought the Black Apricot dress, XXL. For reference I’m 5’10 about 230-240lbs. I’m only giving it 4 stars for now only because I just got it and only tried it on. I haven’t washed it or worn it so I can’t comment on how good the quality of the material is and if it’ll last awhile. But what I can say is when I tried it on I thought it looked wicked cute! I have a bit of a gut and so I’m very self conscious of my weight gain, especially my belly area. This actually covers it up pretty good, it’s not tight at all and fits very comfortably. I think the print in the fabric and belt certainly helps cover up my belly fat and also the high cut waste. The skirt falls right below my knees which is also perfect for someone my age. My back is covered as well and the sleeves are a good length. The top part is a little lower cut than I was expecting but I can always wear a snap in piece on my bra that makes it look like a tank top or part of the dress to cover up the girls for when I’m at work. As of now, I have nothing negative to say about this dress. I really love it! I plan on buying another dress similar to this. It’s also not heavy material and should be nice for the spring and summer months without being too hot. I’m always hot from my weight gain, plus on steroids for health reasons, on top of just turning 40 and possibly going thru early stages of menopause so hot flashes are definitely an issue with what I’m going thru. I’m happy to find something nice I can wear to the office or out and about that didn’t cost a fortune. I’m always hesitant buying clothes online since I’m not seeing it in person, but I can recommend this dress. if you don’t end up liking it you can return or exchange it very easily. It’s one reason why I love buying on Amazon. They make it so easy to return items, most things are generally cheaper then in stores. Also due to my health issues it’s not always easy to go out shopping and to try things on so buying things on here, especially clothing is great! Once I wear it which will Most likely be tomorrow lol, I will try to remember to take a picture to share with my review. I hope this information helps. Read more",

Super comfortable and flattering (have worn them through drastic weight changes) and the pockets are a major selling point. I constantly get asked where I bought the dresses and nobody believes they're from Amazon. They're lightweight but the material hangs nicely and isn't too thing. I would call it a smooth jersey fabric that has stretch and structure. They don't wrinkle and they wash easily in the machine. No pilling, stretching, or other damage from regular wear. Love love love! Read more",

The v-neck cut very lower for me--B cup girl problems :'( Aside from them, the fabric felt cheap and unbreathable--not worth $35. I enjoy that it has pockets and a false belt, though I wouldvtle like the belt buckle, which was slightly off centered, to me more intentionally off to one side. Read more",

I am 5'9 and 200 lb with a larger chest. It was perfect! The fabric is super soft and comfortable. It's a little thicker so you can't see through it at all. The fabric does give a little stretch if needed. the cleavage is a little low but it could be easy to potentially pin if you want. The pockets are great! They are deep and the way that the fabric folds in the skirt. You can't even tell if you have a phone in there. Definitely a good dress for the price I paid.
