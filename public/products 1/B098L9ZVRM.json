        "body": "This dress is soooo soft! It is a bit thinner and more unstructured than pictured. I have worn it twice, both times with an additional long sweater in tow as I live in Chicago and the weather in October has an identity crisis every year. It was also the perfect weight for my crazy peri nonsense. Hot/cold/hot/cold, and now it’s all your fault, wait, no, it’s mine. Everything makes me sad, angry, hot, or cold. Or something in between and no one can explain any of it. I swear!! Anyway, this dress was awesome to wear to make me feel kinda fancy while still pajama comfortable. (THE ideal clothing!!) Tights or leggings with some bootie heels (mine were small wedge), and a nice longish necklace. The buttons seem to be made out of really nice polished coconut shell. Might be wrong, but it’s a nice touch even though they are decorative only. It also has good pockets! I should’ve put that first. I may have gotten a size too large. I was 5’9” at 20. Thirty years later, apparently I am now 5’6.7”. What!?!? I don’t believe that. Also, as of the same dr visit I am 206lbs. That seems unreal except for when I try to stand from a kneel without a sturdy object to leverage myself. I did quit smoking last year. Anyway: Fantastic value! Leave me one!! Read more",

Soft & stretchy, but still has a little structure. I won’t even mention - but just did - POCKETS!!! I wouldn’t put a bunch of stuff in the pockets because anything over an AirPods case and/or key fob definitely distorts the shape of the dress. My phone in the pocket made it look pretty weird, but it definitely fit lol. For reference, 5’6”, 148 & I sized down to a small. It fit perfectly.

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Black Grey White, Dark Grey, Gl- Multicolor Stripes, Black, Camel, Coffee, Ei0941- Red, Gs- Christmas Elk, Eg- Black White Grid, Gt- Deep Caramel, Gu- Deep Rose Purple, Ge- Light Grey, Ec- Burn Red, Ef- Chocolate. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
