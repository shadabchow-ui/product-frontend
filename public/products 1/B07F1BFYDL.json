        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Dressmaker's View....Perfect Formal Dress for All Body Types, High Quality for an Amazing Low Price!",
        "body": "The media could not be loaded. The “72 STYLES Infinity Dress with Bandeau, Convertible Bridesmaid Dress, Long, Plus Size, Multi-Way Dress, Twist Wrap Dress” arrived in 3 days and was nicer than described online. I chose this bridesmaid’s dress for myself and 3 other attendants for a late Spring wedding. I have designed and sewn custom Bridal Gowns and attendants' gowns for many years. The truth today is that quality fabric by the yard is very expensive. If on a budget, then this high quality \"72 Styles Infinity Dress\" is a 5*+ winner. It has many exceptional features at a very affordable price. PROS: When the first bridesmaid's dress arrived and was tried on by the attendant, she sent a photo to the Bride-to-Be, who exclaimed, \"I'm so excited! You look like a Grecian Goddess!\" (see photo). * High Quality Materials and Construction - The exquisite soft hand and hefty richness of the \"Blush Pink\" fabric was immediately impressive. I also noticed that the dress was amazingly wrinkle free right out of the bag and box. Within 24 hours of hanging in a humid bathroom area, it was entirely wrinkle free. * Unbelievably comfortable to wear in any style that you choose! * Excellent attention to detail - all seams are encased, neatly sewn to accommodate 4-way stretching, and there are no loose threads. This dress can be hemmed if desired. * The soft and satiny fabric has an eye-catching, subtle sheen to it, adding to its beauty and attractiveness. Fabric is made of 92% Polyester for strength and 8% Spandex for elasticity. * The really unique advantage of this amazing, patented gown is that you have 72+ bodice styles to choose from. Go online to You Tube at home or in the library and check out the videos that offer tutorials on bodice-styling variations. You are only limited by your imagination. When practicing, it's helpful to have a buddy behind you to help you with draping and ties. I practiced alone in front of a full-length mirror with a hand-held mirror assisting me in viewing the back. Bringing all the bridesmaids dresses to your Bachelorette party and experimenting is even more fun. * Everybody has a different shape and size, and being able to customize a dress to your own flattering, personal style and preferences is a real asset. Different bodice designs bring a lovely variety to the wedding party.... or you can all wear the same style bodice and wear that unique dress in different complementary colors. * There are 30 gorgeous, elegant colors and unlimited styles from which to choose and/or invent yourself. * Style-wise, the two gently pleated, slightly overlapping bodice pieces that rise up from the waist are a generous 12\" in width and 78\" (6-1/2') in length. That gives you an amazing amount of fabric to drape, twist, wrap and tie in unlimited ways around your neck, waist and upper body. If you don't require that much fabric in bodice ties, develop your own \"haute couture.\" You can neatly cut some fabric off to fashion hair ties, weaves, bows, small drawstring bags and more to complement your outfit. * This is a \"one-size fits all\" dress, recommended for US sizes 0-16. I wear a size 16, as I am big-boned, 5'8\", 38B and 155 lbs. The dress fits me perfectly. I am probably near the upper limit as far as elasticized waist, length and bandeau fit go. * The tube top/bandeau (for added modesty) that arrived with my 0-16 dress measures 12' x 14\" and may offer little support for oversized girls. Consider purchasing a complementary bandeau with more support. * This Eye Candy formal dress can be worn repeatedly to different events by varying the bodice style. If you need a long dress for one occasion and then tire of it, you can shorten the dress to knee or cocktail length for a different occasion. The cut-off fabric could make a beautiful matching cape or bolero jacket. * One Size Plus is available for women who wear US 18-24. Once again, large-chested women may want to purchase their own sturdy, coordinating bandeau that offers more support and coverage than the skinny tube top offered for free with the dress. * An ideal dress for pregnant women, the stretchy fabric drapes and flows well around the contours of the body. Just place the elastic waistband over your baby bump. After delivery, the dress still fits. It is especially useful if you are nursing. No need to buy additional maternity wear for a formal occasion. * The gorgeous Blush Pink fabric is True to Color. The fabric is stretchy and is non-see-through on me. Of course, fabric stretching increases the degree of see-through. If so, a half-slip can be worn underneath for more coverage if desired. * The dress hangs, drapes and flows with movement beautifully. * Ideal dress for many occasions as it takes up little space when neatly folded - a \"travel\" gown that resists wrinkles, prom, wedding, evening out, party, maternity, cruise-wear, award recognition night and more. * Recommended hand wash only in cold water for this non-shrink fabric. CONS: * NO INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED! You Tube videos and other online info to the rescue! ... Or use your own wonderful imagination! SUMMARY: Fashionable, inexpensive, cool and comfortable, easy care, adjusts perfectly to weight changes, limitless style possibilities.... all in one beautiful dress. As you read the many reviews, think about the $53 you are spending. This is not a $150 to $200 dress. If that's in your budget, then look elsewhere. For $53, this is an incredibly good-looking and good value for the money! Enjoy! Highly Recommended. ***How to Hang Long Dress Wrinkle-Free*** Step 1: Choose a hanger with shoulder notches (please see photos). Step 2: Attach each white loop inside the dress to the shoulder notches on the hanger. Step 3: Allow the two bodice sashes to fall to the floor. Step 4: (a) Fold one bodice sash in half, vertically and neatly. (b) Carefully lift the sash up and place over the shoulder notch. Step 5: Secure the sash in place with a clothespin. Let the sash end extend down about 12”. Make sure the sash is flat on both sides, with no twisting. Repeat with second bodice sash. Step 6: Fold the bandeau/tube top in half. Step 7. Secure bandeau in place with clothespins at the top of the hanger. Read more",

        "body": "I was actually surprised for quality for the price! Needed a formal dress for a Christmas Ball in a short time frame - while also being 8 months pregnant! The color of the dress is a beautiful deep red, with a nice satin finish. The fabric is stretchy, thicker than anticipated but in a good way, and honestly lovely. I am small, so was hesitant with the one-size fits all pitch, but I feel it fits me perfectly. Definitely plan on some kind of sticky bra to wear under, as a straps in the back would be exposed unless you wear the slip provided. Many ways to tie this dress to fit your preferred style.

My bridesmaids had very different body types and heights (from 5'3\" to 5'10\" and cup sizes from B to G), and each of them was able to style the dress in a way that fit and flattered their shape. The fabric is soft, comfortable, and drapes beautifully. The color was exactly as pictured and looked great in photos. After seeing how versatile it was for my wedding, I bought one for myself and loved wearing it just as much. Highly recommend for weddings, events, or anyone looking for a customizable and comfortable dress! Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.",
