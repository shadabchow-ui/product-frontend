        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Exactly what I wanted for vocal and cello performance in \"concert black\"",
        "body": "I am a musician and purchased this \"concert black\" dress for a choral performance and a cello performance. It is absolutely perfect for this. The lace on the top is soft and beautiful and not see-through anywhere on the bodice. The neckline is pretty without being too deep. The sleeves are a little more sheer - but still very lovely and conservative. The lace is somewhat stretchy also, so it very comfortable on the arms (ideal for cello performance.) The skirt is full enough for cello, but structured enough so it hangs beautifully. Thanks to the fitted aspect of the bodice, it is quite flattering to the figure. I am very pleased with this dress! Highly Recommend! Read more",

        "body": "This dress isn’t just beautiful, it’s comfortable and elegant! The top is a soft lace, not too hot or cold, true to size, and has decent stretch to forgive sizing mistakes, even in the lace. I could have just bought an XL for a comfortable, snug fit. But I went with 2XL and have a little more wiggle room than I need, yet it still looks gorgeous. For reference, 5’6”, a proportional 210, meaning my weight is evenly distributed; meaning I don’t have just a big butt or belly, but everything is spread between thighs, butt, arms, and whatnot. This is an incredible dress, flows like an A-line. Lovely. Read more",

The dress will look good on some people but I need a full skirt. I feel like the two pleats on each side of center puckered and just the placement made me look broad. I thought about sizing up but the top fit well and I simply wasn’t a fan of the skirt style. For me it wasn’t flattering. Loved the high rounded back. Many dresses I find have a deep/low back showing off most of what’s above the bra line. Nice dress if you look good in this type of skirt. Read more",

        "body": "The photo of the dress is VERY misleading. We're very disappointed with what we received versus what we expected, so we're returning it. We bought this for our daughter for orchestra concerts, but it's not gonna work. First, the dress is sheer. Like, we held it up against a wall, and I could still see the wall through all 4 layers of the skirt (2 layers, front and back). I didn't take a photo of that since I'm not sure my camera would see the difference, but be aware it's not as thick as it seems and probably would not work with stage lighting. Second, it's VERY short. It's shown to be an ankle-length dress in the photos, but on my 5'4\" daughter, the bottom was 2 inches below her knee. You'd have to be 4'11\" and shorter for it to be ankle-length, but even then it wouldn't fit you in the shoulders because the shoulders were very wide, even though we bought a size Small. There is NO way this is the same dress on that model who's probably 5'7\"+. Third, the photo makes it look like it's only sheer lace in the sleeves (from the shoulders down) and lined everywhere else, but from the bust up, it's all UNLINED. This is not at all what was advertised. Be warned. Read more",
