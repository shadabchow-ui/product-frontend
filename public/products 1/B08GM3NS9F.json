For reference, I am 5’4”, 34C/36B, 28” waist, and 40” hips at the widest point (aka big bottom girlies can reference this review for help!) Size purchased: Small Pros: - long enough that with or without something at my waist, when my arms go up, my butt is still covered - the cinching at the wrists is PERFECT - it is soft enough where those of us with sensory issues can wear this without a bra - color is is exact to picture Cons: - it is shapeless at the midsection, so it looks very silly on me without something cinching my waist - it is not 100% opaque. I don’t care about my areola showing so I won’t be wearing a bra, but nude thong or something similar is the way to go - NOT squat proof 🤷🏼‍♀️ - when I stick my arms out or up, the sleeves will ride up about an inch. This doesn’t bother me because I wear watches and bracelets but I can see this bothering tall folks FOR SURE - I haven’t washed it yet and I’m a little nervous it will shrink if I dry it Overall, I planned to wear this with something tied at my waist because I knew this was not a bodycon dress. For my use, perfect. For someone who is trying to wear a bra or colored underwear, consider a darker color. Love that the length is not too short but still super cute. Read more",

        "body": "I’m happy with this sweater dress, for an Amazon purchase! TLDR; it’s comfy and fits as expected. Quality doesn’t blow me away, but no real issues and does what I was looking for. I ordered the apricot color because it looked ivory/cream in the photos. I would say it’s more like a light beige in reality - a bit warmer/more tan than the picture - but still a good neutral tone that I can wear with brown or black. I’m usually an XS in tops and dresses (5’7”, petite frame, ~120 lbs), but I wanted this to be A) long enough to fully cover my thighs, and B) not tight fitting, so I ordered the S which fits pretty much as I hoped. It’s short enough that I’d still want to wear it with tall boots but not too short. Nice and loose but not in a boxy way that looks like I’m swimming in it. Could be cute belted. The fabric was a little creased from being packaged, but it came mostly out after hanging for a while, and you could always steam it. I am VERY sensitive to itchy fabrics (can’t wear wool and a lot of acrylics drive me crazy too) and this was comfy, smooth, stretchy fabric. Kind of mid-weight and not a scratchy kind of material at all. Not sure how long it will hold up (a little worried it will get stretched out around the bottom), but so far so good after one wear.

I have super long legs and was able to wear this as a dress & even was able to belt it and still had plenty of room in length. It was not tight on me and loose around the arms as depicted. Wish I had a photo I’ll upload one next time I wear it. It is super soft, comfortable and warm. The quality was definitely better than expected! Con- the only negative was, yes this is a turtle neck but it seemed like A LOT of fabric. I fixed this by tucking the neck of the sweater inside and then you can adjust how much you want to cover your neck. Read more",

But after two washes, it shrank and is a bit too short to be office appropriate :/ for reference, I'm 5'2 and a normal weight, it covered about 2/3-1/2 of my thigh at first. Now it only covers a third of my thigh. Since it's so stretchy I may be able to stretch it with weights/heavy books but I wouldn't doubt that it would bounce back. Also the material is pretty thick and heavy, so while it's amazingly warm, I've only worn it 3 times. I also don't think I'd be able to wear it past early spring, which it now is. But it's a good around the house dress, I can put my arms and legs in and ball up in it when I'm cold haha Read more",

It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Wine, Pumpkin, Apricot, Black, Camel, Dark Green, Pink Apricot, White, Coffee Gray, Purple, Light Pink, Navyblue, Caramel.
