        "body": "The media could not be loaded. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Birthday baddie vibes! This gold dress was everything for my birthday! It’s sparkly, stretchy, and hugs all the curves just right. I’m 5’5”, XL, and curvy — it fit perfectly! The material feels thick and great quality too. I paired it with gold sparkly heels, and it was a whole look! ✨ I didn’t even have to use a body shaper, the stretch of the dress is very forgiving. And it actually does run big. You can even go a size smaller, if you want a sexy fit like I did lol. I went one size smaller, based off of other reviews. You can cinch the side up or wear it longer for a more conservative look. I Got sooo many compliments all night! 💛✨ Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Dress Bodycon Ruched Cocktail is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Light Blue, Gold Bronze, Silver, Wine Red, Gold Pure, Green, Grey. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
