The fit is flattering, but the quality doesn’t quite match the higher price tag. After the first wash, it came out completely wrinkled and very hard to smooth out, which makes it less practical for everyday wear. Overall, nice design but too expensive for what it is and disappointing in durability. Read more",

It is the absolutely most perfect summer dress if I wore it once I wore it 25 times this summer I washed it dried it in the dryer many times and I have to tell you it comes out looking brand new each time. Eyelet is one of those fabrics that never go out of date and always look fresh as a daisy. I love this dress and I bought it in black as well. They are my go to when I just have to pull one out quick and go where I need to go. I would give this a 20 if I could I’m 73 years old and it makes me look young, but it looks appropriate for me. I get compliments everywhere I go. I match it with gladiator sandals. I match it with cute flats. I match it with these really fun Amazon shoes that have flower pattern all over them. They come in all colors. I wear the black and I wear the white with these things sometimes I wear yellow shoes and I match it with a yellow cardigan. These dresses are amazing. Read more",
