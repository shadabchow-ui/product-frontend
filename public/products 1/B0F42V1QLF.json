        "body": "I bought this dress for my sister and she loved it. The burgundy color is beautiful and looks even better in person — very elegant and perfect for a special event. The fit was flattering and true to size (XL), giving a nice shape without feeling tight or uncomfortable. The fabric has good stretch and feels soft on the skin. The length is appropriate and the sleeves make it look classy, while still being easy to move in. It was a great choice for a party and looked amazing in photos. Pros: • Gorgeous color and flattering fit • Comfortable stretchy material • Perfect for parties or special occasions • Looks elegant in photos Cons: • Wrinkles easily, so steaming is needed before wearing Overall, a lovely dress and a great value for the price.

The cut is very flattering and hides tummy bulge nicely. I like the length of the sleeves and the high neckline - a classic look with pearl jewelry. I didn’t bother with the belt. It doesn’t enhance the lines of the dress and is a pain to keep in the right place on your waist. I got many complements on this dress and am glad I bought it. Read more",
