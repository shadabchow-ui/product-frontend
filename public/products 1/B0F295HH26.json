I could also see myself wearing this on a date. The olive color was gorgeous and I love the satin made it so classy but sexy at the same time. I’m 5’5 and it came right above the knee. I got the large and I’m 208 pounds and fits so beautifully. I’d love to get the black color now .

My upper half, chest size, is a C/D cup, and I could have potentially worn a strapless bra, but I opted not to. The top part of the dress did roll down a bit, revealing the white interior liner, but it didn’t bother me. I didn’t have to constantly pull it up, but I also felt that I could have sized down for a more fitted look. Read more",
