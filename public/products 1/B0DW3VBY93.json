        "body": "Will have to pin closed a little more and figure out how to keep inner slip from riding up. The slit unfortunately is up to my anatomical crotch. I think a larger size might have helped this but I am small up top and I’m not sure I could go larger there. It’s a nice color and attractive on though. Moving around will be tricky due to riding up and high slit. Other than that the material is comfortable. Not see through. Doesn’t highlight imperfections like belly. Camouflages well a little pooch. I think the adjustable tie at neck is good to customize fit for different size chests too. Read more",

        "body": "I started to give the dress a 1, but that may be a little harsh. It has potential, but like the last reviewer, it fits weird. I couldn't get it to not ride up, definitely need a body shaper if you don't want every dent showing. The main flaw...the stupid inside-out sewn slip!! It shows drastically through the material on the sides because the inside-out seems are so thick and the dress, so thin. It looks like someone in 7th grade home economics sewed this. It's super cute but the top also has huge gaps around the armpits, as if it needs to be taken in some. I'm a 36D and the large has too much room around the arm area, leven tightening the strings around the neck doesn't help. It also runs small, so I ordered med and large. I returned the medium, thinking the large was the answer. The seems, armpits, and material being too thin, totally disappointed me. It may work for someone because it's extremely cute on. I wanted to wear it so badly that I was willing to overlook the armpits and wear a cute sheer tie up blouse, but couldn't get past the undesirable, noticeable double seems on both hips...don't bother trying to line them up because it's not going to stay aligned Read more",
