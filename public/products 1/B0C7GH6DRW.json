        "body": "When I ordered the dress, I was concerned it would be too short. But the length came just about 3 inches above my knee, so it's still classy for the Holidays. The material is very thick, so it is warm. You can tie the bow in front or in the back to make the dress fit a little tighter, which I appreciated. The color was gorgeous, a hunter/kelly green. Can wear anytime. I would be another one, but I have way too many clothes. I needed it for a holiday party and chose green instead of my typical red. But I am a fan. I bought a medium. I usually wear a size 8 in dresses. Fit fine, not too snug or too big, just right. Read more",

        "body": "I absolutely love this HOTOUCH dress! It’s soft, comfortable, and warm enough for cooler fall and winter days without feeling bulky. The crewneck and long sleeves give it a classic, cozy vibe, and the fit is really flattering — not too tight, not too loose. It pairs perfectly with boots and a scarf for an easy, stylish look. The material has a nice stretch and holds up well after washing, too. I’ve already gotten compliments every time I’ve worn it! Definitely a great addition to your cold-weather wardrobe — I’m thinking of grabbing it in another color! Read more",

I haven’t even washed it yet and it’s small on me. These sleeves are short- fits me more like 3/4 length sleeves, so I have to push them up and wear a jacket if going outside. The material is thick but not soft- it’s a bit rigid. The belt lands just under your bra line like an empire waist, which I wasn’t expecting. The length is good- hits mid thigh.

But there was a replacement sent within a few days, so that was great. When I finally got to wear it, I noticed these couple of spots where the threading is a completely different color. Not really noticeable unless you look closely, but not quality. The belt loops are flimsy. The fabric and color are nice, I got a lot of compliments and it keeps you warm. The length is good (above the knees), and with the chilly weather it goes well with boots. Read more",

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Bodycon Long Sleeve is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.\n\nComfort comes from both the cut and the fabric, so selecting your preferred fit makes a noticeable difference over a full day of wear.",

Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory.
