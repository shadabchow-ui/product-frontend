The material is soft, stretchy, and flattering in all the right places without feeling tight or uncomfortable. The slit? Chef’s kiss. It’s bold but tasteful! The perfect amount of leg without crossing into too much.This neckline gives it a modern, elegant twist that sets it apart from all the other black dresses out there. I’ve worn plenty of dresses that claim to “hug your curves,” but this one actually does it in a way that makes you feel snatched, confident, and totally yourself. I felt sexy, strong, and like I owned the room. Looking for any and every opportunity to wear this dress again If you’re on the fence, just get it. This little black dress is truly that girl.

It was easy to put on and take off. I really like the zipper on the side. It felt great on. The material inside the dress felt soft on my skin. The material was thick enough so you could not see through. The slit was the perfect length. It was very easy to walk in including walking up steps. It was ready to wear right out of the bag. I put the dress in a duffle bag to transport it to a wedding. It did not have to be ironed when it took it out of my bad. The dress held shape, color and fit when washed and dryed. I did not need onion the dress as I took it straight out of the dryer and f hung it up. It is ready to go for the next event.
