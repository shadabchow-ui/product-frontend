        "body": "I was pleasantly surprised by this dress! The price was great, the quality is decent, and I love that there are so many color options to choose from. I’m 7 months pregnant and wearing a medium, it fit comfortably and is flattering without overemphasizing the bump. The flowy, tiered design makes it easy to move in and still feel put together. Perfect as a wedding guest dress, but versatile enough for other special occasions too. Definitely a great find! Read more",

It was the perfect color and the perfect shape. The quality is great, does not look cheap, I’m normally an Anthropologie girly, I don’t like cheap materials lol. I do not wear sleeveless because of excess skin from weigh loss, this dress covered all of it, it goes really high up on the armpit and back fat area. I wore pasties as it comes with a lining bra. I usually wear a Medium but I went with a Large and I’m glad because it was comfortable and loose and airy. I’m 5’3, 175 lbs. I now want to buy this dress in multiple colors! Read more",

I would have returned if I had not thrown away the original packaging. If someone has a hack to get wrinkles out of polyester- please share. Pictures are of the front of the dress.
