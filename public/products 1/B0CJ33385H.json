I work it with some wedges and it was breathable, lightweight, but not to the point of being see through thanks to the lining underneath. The quality is very nice and doesn’t look cheap. The fit for the dress was fine however I am a 36C and 165lbs and it was a little loose on the bust but the dress itself fit perfect. I ordered a medium. I suppose I could’ve gotten a small but I didn’t have time before my trip to wait for another size. I did wash it on delicate and hung it to dry and no changes.

This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",
