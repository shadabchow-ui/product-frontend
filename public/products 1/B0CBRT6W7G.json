For reference, I’m a 32B bust so the chest area was a bit roomy on me, and it had a slight tendency to roll up, but otherwise, the fit was perfect and very flattering. It hugs in all the right places and the back slit at the bottom adds just the right amount of sophistication. I’ve received many compliments every time I’ve worn it! The material is comfortable, easy to steam or iron if wrinkled, and washes beautifully. I love how versatile it is. I wore it with heels as a wedding guest for a dressier look, and also paired it with booties (as pictured) for a work event. Definitely a great staple piece for any wardrobe! Read more",

It’s large cup size friendly, I’m 5’3 ,130lbs and 32DDD, I actually had a strap bra on but I slid the straps down and they held the dress on my shoulder preventing it from sliding up while also keeping my boobs lifted!!

The material is stretchy and thick all around except for the sleeves, which are see through. The shoulder part does ride up a bit and I can see how that could annoy someone, but I didn’t mind that too much. Still loved the way it fit and looked.
