        "body": "I recently purchased the NUFIWI Women Summer Strapless Knitted Long Dress in size medium, and it has quickly become one of my favorite summer outfits! The off-shoulder design, combined with the stylish stripes and cutout details, makes for a stunning and eye-catching look. The bodycon fit and backless style enhance the overall elegance, making it perfect for beach outings and summer parties. The dress is incredibly comfortable to wear, thanks to its soft, breathable knitted fabric. However, it's worth noting that the material is a bit see-through. This isn't a deal-breaker for me, since I like to wear a body shaper under dresses, but it’s something to consider if you’re looking for more coverage. Overall, this dress is a fantastic addition to any summer wardrobe. It's stylish, comfortable, and perfect for making a statement at any sunny event. Highly recommended for those who love to embrace a chic, beachy vibe! Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Bodycon Off Shoulder is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: A, C Striped Apricot, C Solid Red Pink, B Stripe 2, B Stripe 4, B Stripe 3, Black, C Solid White. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
