        "body": "I purchased the white, which is actually winter white so it’s got some yellow in it. The polyester in it should stabilize the product for shrinkage. The hem is stitched at the bottom so it should stop the fraying from continuing. This is a young stylish trend, but it is not a classic look. I’m 52 and the small fits fine across the chest, but the back seems a little tight and I’m small across that area so beware the sleeves are petite length for a small and they’re fine for me but if you have long arms, beware. The is OK on me maybe a little bit above the knee so it’s OK as a dress. For five 2 size small it is not a mini dress as shown on page model. I only bought this because of the long sleeve and white is hard to come by in a dress unless you’re spending over $200. Read more",

        "body": "I absolutely love this denim shirt dress from Zilcremo! It’s the perfect mix of casual and trendy. The distressed details add just the right amount of edge without going overboard, and the button-down design gives it a versatile feel — I can wear it as a dress, layer it over leggings, or even style it open as a tunic over a tank top and shorts. The denim is soft and not too heavy, making it comfortable for all-day wear. I also love the slightly oversized fit — it gives that relaxed, lived-in look that’s still flattering. The length is perfect for pairing with boots or sneakers, and the long sleeves can be rolled up for a more laid-back vibe. Overall, it’s a stylish, easy-to-wear piece that works great for brunch, errands, casual Fridays, or even dressed up with accessories for a night out. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a go-to denim piece with personality! Read more",
