        "body": "This dress is lightweight and comfortable! It comes very wrinkled so a quick wash or ironing is needed before wearing. Purchased the black/blue and love the color! With the bottom material not being stretchy I purchased the XL, since my extra weight is more in my lower half, and it fits decently well. It’s a smidge loose under my armpits but not enough for others to notice. I’m 5’7” to help give an idea on length of the dress. I will definitely get good use out of it. I think it will be easy to dress up or down with styling so it’s nice to have that option! It does have slits on both sides- I was able to wear my short leggings underneath but if you’re a slip-wearing person, it will need to be short or it will show when you sit. Read more",

The Navy dress fit perfectly and was lovely. The bodice fit is very comfortable. The navy dress has a slip lining. I’ll give the navy dress five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The black and rose dress, also beautiful had a bodice that fit like an XS, not a small. It was so tight and was really uncomfortable. There was NO slip lining in this dress, even though both dresses are made by the same company. Why are these dresses so different? I’m going to return the black and rose dress and repurchase it, hoping to get a fit like the navy dress. If not, I’ll return it. The same two dresses shouldn’t be so different from one another.
