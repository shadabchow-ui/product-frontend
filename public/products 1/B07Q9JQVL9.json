        "body": "The things I really like about this dress are, first of all, it looks great, the print is beautiful, I love the style, this dress is very flattering, and I also love that it has pockets, huge bonus for me. I am 5ft 2in, 137 lbs. 36-D bra size. I ordered this dress in a medium, it does fit and it looks great, but it is a little tight at the waist. I does fit me a lot better when I wear shape wear underneath. It looks like it fits perfect. A large may have been better for my size though, but I worry a large would look too big, and not as fitted (I don’t know because I haven’t tried the large). The dress is mid-calf length on me, which I think is perfect. This dress does have two downfalls for me, both of which I might not have if I had gotten the large instead of medium, but I once again, I don’t know because I have not tried it on in a large. The first is that it was very tricky to zip up, I could not zip it up myself, I had to get my spouse to zip it for me. The other downfall for me is that I do have slightly limited range of motion in my shoulders and upper arms in this dress, it does not fit me quite right in the underarm area, which does limit my arm movements a little. For the most part this is not a problem because most of the time I am going someplace that I need to be dressed nice, I don’t need to move my arms that much, but it would make it hard to hold a baby or toddler, or dance, and it also makes it so it would be hard for me to wear to work. I would say the quality of this dress is medium, it is not a super high quality fabric, but it is not low quality either. The fabric is thin, but not see through, and I have no complaints about the quality of fabric or the stitching. Overall, I am very pleased with this dress, it is beautiful, very flattering, and very good deal for the price. Read more",

        "body": "I should have read through all the reviews and remembered the fitting issues others had before getting this dress. One reviewer mentioned that she had to keep pulling it down to fit at the waist and that is exactly what I had an issue with. The color and print was very pretty and flattering, not too garish and it looked nice for the occasion I wore it to. It could very easily be worn to a wedding, dinner out, party or special occasion and it could also work in an office. But because I have a short waist, it didn’t fit as comfortably as I would have liked, I will probably not wear this as often as I’d hoped. But it’s a nice enough dress to keep and not return. I would consider getting a size up for a bit more room but worried it would be too big and fall off the shoulders, so the size was close. The pockets are a nice touch and certainly not common in dresses. I would say overall it is a good dress for the price and a good value but it really does have a few minor things that prevent me from wanting more than one color. Length of the dress was below the knee and I did like that. At least the way the dress is made it didn’t show the issues with not fitting the waist as it should. Read more",

It does have a zipper in the back, but the head-hole was stretchy enough for me to pull it over my head, and flory enough to hide a little tummy of you have one!
