I am thicker in the tummy area, so I wore spanx under the dress to hold my tummy in. The way the fabric of the dress bunched up, it helped to hide my tummy area. My arms are a little flabby so the flowy sleeves were a perfect cover up. I wore it for 12 hours straight and it was very comfortable. I would order this dress in a different color.

        "body": "Wife: Body fit well. Sleeves are just wow. They’re even poofyier than in the picture. Body of the dress was flattering for a petite woman with a mom tummy. The ruching hid things well. Neckline was sexy but not too low. At 5’2” the skirt was tight and short but not inappropriate in any way. Overall, it flattered my body. What hurt my soul was the sleeves. They were about 4 inches too long, and I have very long arms. But the poof. Whoa. At full capacity I’d bet they’re 16” in diameter. It’s an amazing waste of fabric. Half as much would look more like the model and less like an 80s prom - and not a good one. I looked at just removing the sleeves, but it wouldn’t be that easy. You’d have to cut some sort of cap sleeve shape and hope the mesh tule holds up in some way. Modifying just wasn’t worth it for a $30 dress. Returned. Quickly. Read more",
