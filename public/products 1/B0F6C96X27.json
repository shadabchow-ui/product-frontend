The neckline is flattering but not too low. The length is perfect for me, just below mid calf. It's the perfect weight for fall and milder winter days. It's going to be so comfortable for the fall event I'm attending. The color seems to be a reasonable match for what I saw on my screen. I love the tone on tone effect and the texture of the fabric. Oh, I forgot to mention the pockets! They are well placed and deep enough to hold a tissue, chapstick or lipstick. This dress is a winner. It has me wondering, where have you been all my life?! Note on fit: Amazon suggested small, I ordered medium and it's a perfect fit. 135 lbs at 5'5\" and 34 DD/DDD depending on bra brand. Busty ladies, I'd go one size up from Amazon's suggestion.
