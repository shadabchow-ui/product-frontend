It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.",
