Like many, she must wear another layer 'twixt her tender skin and wool, but wool is warm, even in damp weather, looks great and lasts really long. I'd imagine the time will come when one of our grandaughters will be happy to inherit this timeless sweater, and it will look great on her, too. Get the good stuff, take care of it, and it'll take care of you. Read more",

        "body": "Many visitors to California's central coast are surprised to find how cold it gets here year-round mornings & evenings. I wear a cardigan pretty much every day. Prior to this purchase on Amazon, I've bought a few merino wool Irish sweaters from a well known TV shopping network at much higher prices. I'm thrilled with my recent purchase of this Carraig Donn A Line Aran Knit Cardigan. Ordered on the 15th of April, it arrived from Ireland today... the 21st! The purple color is lovely and just as shown on its product page. New, out of the package, it seemed somewhat small for a large, but knits often are; the knit will loosen somewhat with wear. The yarn isn't as beefy as other Irish sweaters I've purchased in the past. That's good for two reasons: first, it won't be too hot in warmer weather (40-60 degrees), and secondly, it won't make you look 10-15 pound heavier layered over a long sleeved shirt or turtleneck in winter. The a line shape is flattering. It seems to be well made. As with all wool sweaters, you'll want to air it for a few days before wearing or storing. I've been told to always store sweaters like this in a drawer. The company included a nice note and a tote bag with my purchase, as well as a small catalog of their other offerings. Very happy!

Decided on this birthday to treat myself and found this sweater on Amazon was priced better than on other sites. It is warm, and so pretty! The buttons slip through small openings, the button holes are not stitched which is great because when wearing it unbuttoned it looks perfect, no big button holes standing out. If they had the raspberry color that I saw on another site I would buy it again. Read more",

The knit is so loose, when putting the sweater on it stretches out making holes (!) in the pattern and compromises any styling. The sleeves are enormous and way out of proportion. The green color is much lighter than shown. Instead of a rich green, it is washed out and unremarkable. The buttons are large and in a brown wood instead of matching green as shown. Buyer beware.
