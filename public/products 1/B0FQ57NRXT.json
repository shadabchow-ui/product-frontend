The fabric could be better quality, but at least it won’t get too wrinkly or pill hopefully. Plus, it’s got pockets- which every dress should have! It’s a timeless style as well. I think this is the winner for family photos this year- and boy, I think I tried on half of Amazon’s selection here. Whew, glad that’s over with. But, so grateful for the hassle free returns.

        "body": "At first I was skeptical with lack of reviews. However I took a chance and I’m obsessed! I’m 210 lbs and 5 ft 6. I ordered an xl and it fits great. It’s very stretchy so I could have ordered a large no problem and it would have fit. I also am very large up top and I love how this fit and stretched. The quality of the fabric is great. It’s thick enough you can’t see through it but light enough it’s not hot. This is perfect for a summer night or a wedding guest! I styled mine with some boots. Pictures are of me trying it on when I first opened the package so it is a little wrinkled but I’m going to wash it on a light load before a wear it. It also has deep pockets that I really love. It’s always a plus to have pockets when going to events where you don’t want to bring a huge purse. You can see how my entire hand fits in the pocket. 10/10 Will order again in another color. I’ll be wearing this to a wedding so once I wash it, get dolled up, and wear it all night I’ll be sure to update this review. Hopefully the seller can figure out shipping so it doesn’t take as long but I bought ahead of time knowing it would take a while Read more",
