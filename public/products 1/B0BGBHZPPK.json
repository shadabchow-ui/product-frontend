        "body": "I first found a dress at the second hand store, and it was a PrettyGarden brand. I liked it so much I googled them and behold Amazon had it. I happened to get one when it went on sale and I am happy with this one, too. The color is vibrant and beautiful. The material isn't the same as the one I thrifted, but it is still nice and okay though I like the older dress material better. It has a built in slip and it seems true to size. I am normally a M (5'3, 140 lbs) but I wear a L in my chest and I am also a breastfeeding momma! That is why I liked this so much. It is SO easy to breastfeed in. You don't have to buy an overly priced, and also unflattering and ugly nursing dress. Being a V neck and able to unsnap and just pop a feed sack out for your little makes life easy happy. Baby can stay full and happy while mom looks pretty 😊 This is church appropriate. It is very light so good for summer. I ordered a L for my chest (32DD) I wasn't worried about my waist since it has a belt to cinch. Read more",

        "body": "I'm a fan of most things from PRETTY GARDEN, and this Flowy Maxi Dress did not disappoint! I needed a dress for a friend's wedding in Las Vegas and, having waited until the last minute, I ended up buying three dresses on Amazon. This one was the best and also the most affordable. I've been more self-conscious lately due to some weight gain, so finding something flattering was crucial. This dress exceeded my expectations, making me feel great despite my added flaws. It's incredibly comfortable and lightweight, which was perfect for the hot Las Vegas weather. Despite its length and long sleeves, it was surprisingly cool and comfortable. Additionally, it doesn't wrinkle easily, so it went from the suitcase to a minor touch-up with the iron and then straight to the wedding party without any hassle. The cherry on top was that it matched my boyfriend's suit perfectly! If you're looking for a stylish, comfortable, and affordable dress, I highly recommend this one. It was an absolute lifesaver!

I was still able to tie down where it’s larger with the waist tie so the dress still fits without hanging out. The material is very light with a cream liner that covers and hides your underwear. It’s a great dress to wear in the summer or in the spring when it’s still cool. I just added a jean jacket when it was cooler out in the morning and warmed up during the afternoon. Read more",

I would say it’s perfect for spring, fall and maybe summer weather. The length of the sleeves hit just right, as did the length of the dress. Cons: the chest area just hit very strangely on me. I am currently breastfeeding and liked this dress as an option because it had the snap in the middle for easy feeding. The snap didn’t seem to be aligned well though and just gave a very strange look. I’ve been trying to twist the dress thinking that could be the reason but unfortunately, it just returns to this position. For reference, I’m 5’4” and about 180. Read more",

        "body": "This dress is beautiful. Will wear it for church and for special occasions. The bodice has a snap, two more snaps were provided to secure more of the V neckline; which is good because it is too low for me. The fabric is delicate though not see through; it is lined on the bodice and has a knee length lining, as well. The long sleeves are not lined; there is a fabric belt made of the same fabric. The print is lovely. This dress has a nice fuller skirt, which will fit curvy women. The print is lovely and feminine. The workmanship is excellent. I am rather particular about quality, this dress did not disappoint. The dress I chose has a dominant purple color. It also comes in a different shade, the dominant color is a red-orange color; also an attractive color. Though I did not know it, I saw a picture of one of my cousins wearing the dress she purchased in the second red-orange color. Also, I happened to buy this dress when it was on sale. Read more",

  "about_this_item": "Womens Maxi Dress Long Sleeve Maxi V Neck is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",
