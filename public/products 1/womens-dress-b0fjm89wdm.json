        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Cozy & Cute, But Color and Pattern Were a Letdown for Me",
        "body": "I really wanted to love the Dancing Yarns Women's Oversized Sweater — and in some ways, I do! The fabric is incredibly soft, and the oversized, baggy fit is super cozy and comfortable. The lantern sleeves are also a lovely touch and give the sweater a unique, feminine flair. Fit-wise, I’d say it runs true to size — even for an oversized style. It’s roomy without being shapeless, so if you’re aiming for that relaxed look, you won’t need to size up. That said, I was disappointed with the color I ordered (Ancora Red). In the product images, it looked like a vibrant, rich red, but in person, it leans more toward a muted wine color — not quite as flattering or eye-catching as I hoped. The knit pattern on the torso also reminds me of sweaters from the early '90s — eclectic and a bit too busy for my taste, especially when combined with the voluminous sleeves. It just didn’t quite come together for me style-wise. I haven’t worn it out yet since the weather’s still warm, but it definitely feels like it will be warm and cozy come fall and winter. One small downside: I accidentally snagged it on some jewelry while it was hanging in my closet, and now it has a pull in the fabric before I even got to wear it. So be mindful that the acrylic fibers can be delicate around anything sharp or textured. Overall, I’d recommend this sweater if you genuinely love the torso pattern — it's soft, warm, and comfortable. Versatile enough to be tucked in or let it hang! Just be sure to check out the product video (especially the white version), as that gave a more accurate idea of what the sweater really looks like in person. Read more",

It also features a different knit pattern across the bottom half which was not noticeable in the product photos, but I like it. It is extremely comfortable, and because it has polyester you don’t feel overheated. It does appear to have a slight pull in front but I think that will flatten out with some tugging. Read more",

        "body": "This sweater arrived with a noticeable snag right on the front. I tried to get a photo, but I cracked the camera glass on my phone yesterday, so any picture I take now is just a blurry, distorted glare. Thankfully, I was able to pull the snag through to the inside and then stretch the fabric a bit to redistribute the yarn, so it's not visible anymore. Once I got past that, I found that I really like this sweater. The material is soft but also has a little bit of a firmness to it. I'm a big fan of the sleeves, which are slightly poofy but tapered at the wrists. The fit is mostly true to size, with a slight lean towards being larger, but I believe that's the intended style. This isn't a piece I would wear in the dead of winter without a jacket, but it’s perfect for fall. The colors are also true to what was shown on the product page. While it seems well-made, the knitted pattern means you'll probably have to be careful with it, as evidenced by mine arriving already snagged. Still, I'm happy with the purchase. --- For anyone interested, the exact product I purchased was listed as: DancingYarns Women’s Oversized Sweaters Long Lantern Sleeve Pullover Sweaters Trendy Crewneck Knit Casual Loose Jumper Tops (Grey, X-Large) The ASIN for the version I received was: B0FJMFWJZF Read more",

The material is very soft and it will definitely keep you warm in cooler weather. It’s not to heavy but also not to thin. Per the care instructions, I will definitely either wash on cold on gentle or hand wash and hang to dry. That way it keeps its shape and the color doesn’t fade.
