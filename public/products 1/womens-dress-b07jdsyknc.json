I got a small but I think an XS might have been good. They were sold out if that size in blue. My suggested size was a large but that was way too big. This review is about the size small. I will say I love this blue color. It looked like the photos. It's a nice thick, comfy, quality sweater. I really wanted to keep it and it's definitely my vibe but sadly it just didn't look flattering on me. Maybe if I were stick skinny it might have. I have a large chest (39-40 inches) depending on my bra. I wore this with leggings but it still made me look top heavy and big. I'm not big, I'm average as is my BMI. I even wore something very tight underneath to try and compensate for the bagginess but it didn't work. It's a beautiful well made sweater. Sadly the cut and the way it falls just isn't for me but it might be for you. I'm rating it on the quality of the shirt and not on the fact that it didn't look good on me personally. Read more",

Hopefully the material relaxes a bit over time with wash and wear, so it’s not as stiff and has even more of a slouchy feel. It’s not the softest. I do wish that it had pockets. That would’ve been awesome. All in all a good purchase though. I would recommend this product. Read more",

        "body": "Holy compliments y'all. I tend to stick to gray and black in my wardrobe and when I caught this on sale I almost caved and went with my default. The green, however, really caught my eye and I am so glad it did. Every time I wear this I get so many compliments. Not sure what all the other reviewers got that earned so many bad reviews because mine is EXACTLY like the photo and the quality is better than anything I've got at Target or JCPenney. I do see some people mistakenly are wearing it upside down which could be some of the issue. I guess just make sure you are aware which way it goes? lol Anywho, I got the green in medium (it fits me exactly like the model which never happens) and love it so much. It's my new favorite article of clothing and have to resist wearing it twice a week. Will probably wind up buying one in black and maybe the dark gray or navy blue because it adds a lot of versatility to my wardrobe and warmth during the 8 months of winter we get.

The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: One Size.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan.
