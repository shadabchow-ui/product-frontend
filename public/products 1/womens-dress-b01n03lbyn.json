        "body": "I actually got this for my father who is 90 and usually in a wheelchair. Its too hard to get his arms in and out of a jacket because his mobility is limited. This works great for a light cover because he gets chilled in the air conditioning and its easy to take on and off of him. I was worried it might look feminine, but its brown and plaid so a little old man can get by with it. The back is kind of short when you're wearing it, but for us that's perfect because he is always sitting down. This style is good for people in a wheelchair because of that, its not all bulky in the back and there's nothing to sit on. My dad calls it \"his wrap\". Kinda plasticky but serves our purpose and I'm happy with it. Read more",

        "body": "I bought the red one and the navy blue one to go over dresses and sweaters. I LOVE the toggle and the hood; that was why I bought these and not just plain plaid scarves. The navy blue one was softer out of the packaging than the red one--in fact, the red one was scratchy enough that I washed it twice with lots of fabric softener and now it's fine. They are definitely large enough to come down to the waist, and your arms will be entirely covered unless you have extremely long arms. This wasn't quite what I had in mind, but I wore the navy blue one out in the rain recently and it was quite nice having it be longer than I thought. It also kept me warm and dry, so that's a bonus. Definitely recommend. They look very high quality for the price. Read more",

If you like your arms covered but your back exposed just below your shoulder blade area, this poncho will work for you. I like my poncho/shawls to at least come down to below waist area so this one just is okay for me. It is great design and made well, would work for shorter person probably. I am 5'6\", just average female height in the USA. We love to be outside and camp a lot, so I have many ponchos and shawls. I was looking forward to finally having one with a hat to pull on, but this one will be given to one of my preteen grandkids. I would like to mention also it is a thin material for those that would like to know. Made very well, thin material, toggle button to keep on, hat if needed, BUT very short in back of poncho.
