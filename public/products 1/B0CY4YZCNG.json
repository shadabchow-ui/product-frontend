        "body": "Curvy girls know it’s hard to cover just the right places, while achieving a flattering silhouette. This dress did this and more! The mermaid shape accentuated the curves in a good way, and the overlay gave a layer of protection and modesty without covering too much. The peekaboo sleeves showed just the right amount of skin, and the length was perfect! (5’4”) The fabric was a beautiful lace pattern giving it a more expensive look, that had wonderful stretch, and a double layer that made sure there was proper coverage. The overlay also does a fabulous drape down the zippered lace back that is lovely. It was easy to wear, comfortable, and formal. I was completely surprised with the quality for such a good price. I ordered others at this price point and returned them because of their cheap, flimsy fabric. For this price, you can beat it! And it’s full length! It will require a steaming to get the wrinkles out, but it was easy to do. I couldn’t be happier! Read more",

        "body": "Beautiful dress! I ordered it for granddaughter's wedding. Fits well, as expected - I purchased my normal 2x (or 20) size, in Black lace with Chiffon cape. I'm 5'2\", weigh 200-205, and the lacy fabric hides my tummy well. I also wanted something that would continue to fit right up to the date - whether I gained or lost weight - and this dress had enough stretch to do that comfortably. It was a tough choice, but I ended up returning this one and kept the other version with sequin cape and black dress, mostly because I preferred the sparkly look for this festive occasion. But had I needed a dress for a more sedate occasion, I would have definitely kept it! It's really a well made dress, and a quality look for a lower price. Read more",

I wore it to officiate a wedding and it looked great in the pictures. Quality was great and the material felt wonderful. It had stretch to it so you did not feel like you were being confined. Will definitely be wearing this again. Read more",

I got so many compliments. I am short like short short. The dress was long however it was easily maneuverable, I didn't have to worry about wrinkling. I am in a weird in between size between a 24 and 26. I wish I would have sized down but I bought last minute and that was my fault. I would definitely buy this brand again.... I was not disappointed. The dress could easily be worn all year long. It is not too heavy for a summer wedding either. It was beautifully designed and manufactured..... I will definitely get more use out of this dress.

I ordered the dress in a 20 because I didn't want it looking like a loose sack. It fit perfect! The cling was just right with no need to keep adjusting or pulling it down, so I'd say it was a great flow and I loved that the cape flowed down to cover any lumps or bulges that I didn't want displayed. The length came down to just brush the top of my feet. I was very comfortable all night! If I had to find an issue it would be that the neck could have been a bit smaller, I didn't want to keep adjusting so my bra straps weren't showing so I took 2 small safety pins and pinned the dress in place to my bra, problem solved!
