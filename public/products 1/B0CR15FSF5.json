        "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars Sexy, Form-fitting Jean Dress with a Great Design",
        "body": "Loved this dress! It's beautiful, and it looks gorgeous on me. And it looks gorgeous on so many people who have opted to post their photos. I love how it looks on me, but I don't need to share it with the world through a photograph. I'll share my words instead. It's like one of those Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants kind of thing. One reviewer said that the material of the dress isn't good material, and I don't agree with that. The material was fine: stretchy, but it still looked like jean. I mean it's not Levis, but it's good material for what you're paying for. I like the way it makes my tiny waist look. I enjoyed it. I didn't want to pay 40 bucks and almost 44 with tax, but at least it's something I liked. I would have preferred 25 or 30, but when something fits well, you are more willing to pay extra. It also got here super fast, so while I don't agree that there should be next-day shipping for things because that causes the drivers to drive more carelessly. I think that for a customer, you can tell right away if you are going to keep that item of clothing, so it works out if it comes soon, but I do prefer people's safety over convenience, so while it was nice it got here super fast that wasn't necessary. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I'd like them to have this dress as a petite version FOR PETITE BODIES. (I'm writing this in caps in case the brand and people who work for the brand read my review.) Not everyone is tall, people. Certainly not in many countries of the world. People come in all sizes. I am 5 feet, and this dress fits longer than my knees, so while it fits me perfectly everywhere else, length-wise it's a bit too long. I'm going to have to pay to tailor this, but as I like the dress and the way it looks on me, I am willing to spend the money. I also like that you can really dress this dress up or dress it down with tennis or platforms. I am going to dress it up with pumps. It's a well-designed dress. I think what I like the most about it is the design. Someone knew what they were doing out there. I thought it wouldn't fit, but it fit me really well. It's true to size. I took my measurements with a measuring tape, and it was exactly how the measurements said it would be. I'm like 24 or 25 in waist depending on whether I've been eating past 12 a.m or not, so the dress in XS fit me perfectly. I thought it would be too tight, but it wasn't. I'm not saying it's not form-fitting because it's super form-fitting, but it's not so tight that it's uncomfortable. That has to do with the stretchy material. I'm leaving this review because some reviewers almost made me not want to buy the dress with the reviews they left. I'm glad I bought it, and I want to encourage people to try it. It's going to fit differently on everyone, so love your body. For example, I don't have huge breasts nor have I ever wanted big breasts. While all the women around me got breast implants, the thought didn't even cross my mind because I don't compare myself to other people. I love my breasts exactly the way they are. So I say, buy this dress, and if you like how it looks on you, keep it. The dress doesn't make my cleavage pop out, but my breasts look good in the dress because I've never wanted big breasts on me nor do I desire that. I say that in case any petite women who are small breasted want to try the dress, go for it. It looks good. We don't need our boobs to be popping out of the dress in order to prove we have boobs! lol. Even men have breasts, so there's nothing special about having breasts. Everyone has them. Anyways, I am pretty much the measurements of the XS, so the dress fit perfectly on me except for the length, so while I'll have to spend extra to tailor it, everywhere else, it fits well. Love your body exactly the way it is. You'll enjoy life so much more that way. And if you can't love your body then at least practice body neutrality. Feel grateful for what your body can do rather than what it looks like. Anyways, wanted to add that because so many women nowadays compare themselves to other women or don't love their bodies enough. And the \"beauty\" industry fuels that insecurity and makes money off women's insecurities. Love yourself as much you can, women. It'll heal our gender. The more women compete, compare, and not love themselves, the more we suffer as a collective consciousness. Love yourself every day even if it hurts. One day it'll feel good. Read more",

Zipper is not that durable, I had to return the first dress because the zipper broke before I even tried it on. The company sent me a new replacement dress the next day.

This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThis piece transitions well from daytime plans to evening events with a quick change of shoes and a small bag or clutch.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.",
