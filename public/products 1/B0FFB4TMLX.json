        "body": "The dress is pretty but a bit thin. The lace is that thickish feeling lace. It’s an ok dress. As someone mentioned, it is not small chest friendly. I feel my chest looks very much “false advertisement” but it’s still a 34GG/34J. My chest is not full so the dress just looks frumpy on me. The top is still too loose and i wish it was taken in about an inch or so. For fuller large breasted women maybe? It was a back up emergency dress for me, but the dress I wanted came in time. I’ll just tailor the top part later. I do like how it hangs though. I’m pudgy, so I have a tummy. The dress sits nicely across the front and the back sits nicely as well— without special underwear. I am short, so the dress is a little long, but the length is nice. I like the high/low looks of the bottom of the dress. Again my only issue with the dress is the top. I guess this can be a fall dress if you count fall just starting. But later into fall, I don’t see this keeping you warm. The arms are very thin compared to the rest of the dress. Read more",

Lucked out with a cami top I had in exact shade of navy, so I didn’t need to give any thought to the cross-front styling but I could see that being a challenge if you do without (might call for a safety pin).
