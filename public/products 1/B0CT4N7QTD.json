        "body": "This dress was such a hit on a “stars” themed night out! I would recommend some kind of shape wear/shorts, as it is quite short, and also the fabric hugs a bit form fitting. A strapless bra as well, for the less endowed, like me :) Not as sparkly as I expected, but still definitely did the job. The sleeves were comfortable, although they did slide down a tad. I expected them to be a bit longer, but it wasn’t a big deal at all. For reference: Height: 5’5 Weight: 135 Waist: 30” Hips: 39” Body type: long torso, low waist, smaller chest Overall, it was good quality and definitely worth the money. I can’t wait to wear it again!

And the dress itself has layers that kept me for the most part warm during my night out. I would so buy this again! Get the dress ladies!! 🖤🖤 Read more",
