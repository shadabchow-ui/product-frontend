I thought it was stylish, the see-through fabric fun and flirty, and the sweetheart neckline was adorable. the material was light and comfortable, and the stitching was normal. However, I ended up going with a dress a little more fun for the event I was going to. Instead of returning the dress, I gave it to my friend who was also going to the same event. She’s 5’4” and also a 2x. This dress was STUNNING on her. Read more",

        "body": "I absolutely LOVE the design I received!! I ordered the off-the-shoulder dress which had a disclaimer that they’d be randomly sending one of two designs they have for the top. I received the satin-finish looking one and it has subtle little butterflies on it which was so pretty. I really like that the back of it was that stretchy fabric, too. I am plus size but I don’t have the typical plus size proportions (small cup size but wide hips) so I had to order a size 2x to accommodate for that. The top of the dress is a few inches too large for my measurements but it’s easy to tailor the top. I do think that this type of cut on the top is best suited for the girls with larger boobs lol. The skirt of the dress is beautiful! I would just want to be careful about snags and tears because of the lacey fabric. It also looks nice that the underskirt is shorter than the lace skirt! I’m wearing it with a black scarf tied around my waist in the photo, so just know that’s not part of the actual dress! Read more",
