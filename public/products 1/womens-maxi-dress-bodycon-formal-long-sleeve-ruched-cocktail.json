        "body": "Needed a dress for a winter wedding, and felt my existing wardrobe bare-armed choices would all leave me a bit chilly… so I started shopping around. Everything I found in stores was either a) wayyyy too short - I’ve got a great pair of legs but I’m 5’11” and almost 50 and really want to be able to sit down without showing everyone my nether region; b) granny type dresses that look like I’m heading back to the home after the wedding, or c) outrageously priced - I’m all about investing in classic pieces but there’s only so many cocktail dresses I need at this point and Id rather use the $ to buy the couple a nice gift. So, I came searching on Amazon, and found several sellers offering a similar style dress. I purchased two from two different sellers and the Merokeety was by far and away the loveliest choice. I am 5’11” and 142 lbs, so tall and on the thinner side. I ordered a small which is my normal size. The dress is true to size. A small fit me snuggly in that it highlights my curves and is form fitting, but the material is forgiving and stretchy. Love the fit and felt it was so much nicer in the merokeety branded dress. Most dresses are pretty short on me but this dress hits me at just about the knee - so I can dance and move around and not worry about flashing anyone. Also doesn’t seem to be the kind of dress/material that rides up on the legs a lot so I don’t think I’ll be adjusting my skirt all night. It’s not the most expensive feeling material but it doesn’t look cheap or poorly made at all. I love that the Merokeety dress has a zipper up the back as well - it just feels more properly fitted and higher end because of it. The color I ordered was a pretty wine red, a very pretty and a rich, deep color. Overall it’s an attractive dress and I feel sexy in it even if it’s not the sexiest dress on the planet by itself… it’s what I would call sophisticated sexy if that’s a thing. Sort of like what I would picture silver screen sirens wearing - it kind of reminds me of something I’ve seen Sophia Loren in, actually. The only con? The sleeves are a tad short for me, but I have long arms so that’s expected. I like the way the dress looks with the sleeves falling off the shoulder which resolves my issue with sleeve length completely. Overall, very pleased with this dress and highly recommend! Read more",

        "body": "I absolutely love this dress! The royal color is stunning, and the square neckline paired with the ruched design creates a flattering, elegant silhouette. The long balloon sleeves add a stylish and unique touch that really sets this dress apart from typical party dresses. It fits beautifully, hugs all the right places without feeling uncomfortable, and makes me feel confident and put-together whenever I wear it. The material is soft yet structured enough to hold its shape, making it ideal for clubwear, parties, or any special occasion. If you’re looking for a dress that combines elegance, style, and comfort, this is a fantastic choice. I love wearing it and have already received compliments when I’ve worn it out. It's not super thick nor see-through, and somewhat warm. Read more",

As a middle age woman experiencing extra pounds around the middle thanks to peri menopause - I am very appreciative of the ruching. I wanted something that would be formfitting, but not emphasize cellulite on my butt or my thighs plus no need to highlight the pooch or the stomach. There is a weird extra amount of fabric around the zipper though. You have to either tug it down or tug it up to make it not bunch up on the backside. I liked the dress enough that I don't care. I will deal with that. I think it is actually due to extra materials so that it works with your size. So someone who buys the same size dress, but has differently placed curves than me might appreciate the extra fabric there. The sleeves are see-through and beautiful, and I love the neckline. I bought the black and it is not see-through, but I cannot speak to the other colors. The material is not very thick. If you have curves, it will like this. In case it helps someone my measurements are 36DD, 5'6, 150lbs and waist 29. Read more",
