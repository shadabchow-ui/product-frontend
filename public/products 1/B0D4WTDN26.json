        "body": "👗 Absolutely ❤️ this dress! 👗 What a value! 👗 Very well made with beautiful quality knit and nice stretchy material! 👗I purchased in pink and white and ladies, the pink is beautiful, it's just as pictured and the white is a true white! It's not cream or off white!!! YES!!! 👍🏾 👗I am 5.5 and half and 127 pds. I'm slender with bun buns! I knew that I didn't want the body con hugging me or my buns. I didn't want it tight/ fitting to my body. Therefore, I ordered the white in sz L and XL. The XL fit nicely around my bun buns, as I like but too large in the arms. The size large fit perfectly but I better not gain 1 pound or it will be too tight in the bun buns area! 😳 I'll keep the Large. The pink in the XL, however, fit fine. It is a lil large also in the arms but not as noticeable as the white. Likely bc of the color. 👗 It's also a nice length. The white (sz L) falls a lil past my calves. Just as I like, hides my skinny legs! The pink (sz. XL) is obviously just a little longer, still with a very nice fall. 👗I L🤍💗E the long bell sleeves! Gives such a nice stylish edge! 👗 For me, personally, I will definitely wear a slip with both. The material is good quality and again, nicely made knit, with white, a slip is needed in spite of the knit not being thin and see through, especially with having bun buns. 👗Dats All, Ladies! Glad I purchased b4 the price went up! 😉 10/10 Recommend!! 💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍💗🤍 Read more",

I am very self-conscious about my weight gain and my tummy/waistline. I purchased this dress praying it arrived on time, and the fit would complement my weight/shape! This dress did not disappoint. It was packaged perfectly, the material is nice and heavy, the length is perfect for me (5'9\" height). I got so many compliments because it looks expensive and elegant! As a matter of fact, I also ordered a dress from another popular department store that was $500. That dress did not compare to this one and it was returned!
