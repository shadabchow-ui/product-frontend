I’m not sure why since the dress was not tight at all on me and felt very comfortable but I’m disappointed that I wasn’t even able to wear the dress out after trying it on. This dress is so comfortable!! I’m 230lbs and 40D got the XL and it fit super good! It was flattering and the material is very stretchy so I didn’t even have to undo the zipper to get it on (zipper is on the left side under the arm area and it isn’t even noticeable if anyone was curious). It is a bit see through on the breast area so I’d wear something under it just to be safe but the rest of the dress was pretty thick (still breathable though!) I’m 5’0 and it goes down to my knees. I’d like it to be bit shorter but I’m short myself so I don’t consider it a product flaw. Overall super good quality and I love it! Read more",
