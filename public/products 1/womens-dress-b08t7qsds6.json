        "body": "I read some reviews with negative comments regarding fit and material so I’m offering some additional insight so that expectations can be adjusted. I am not paid or receive free merchandise to review. In my opinion, Amazon’s version of the iconic “fisherman” sweater is gorgeous. The classic colors and timeless design offers wardrobe versatility, which is standard for “old money” or “quiet luxury” style. The traditional “regular” fit means sweater body and arms are the same length and design “lines” run down straight from shoulders to hip. Just like a “straight leg” pant/jean in “regular” fit, if you are tall/petite and/or “curvy”, take that into account when choosing a size. The sweater is knitted with a mid-weight (thicker), 100% cotton fiber yarn. Cotton is very durable and gets softer and softer over the years. It is great for warmer climates because it draws heat away from body. 100% cotton yarn or material may or may not be “pre-washed”, if not, it will shrink if heat is applied. 100% cotton fibers have zero elasticity or “memory” so once maintaining original shape (after getting wet) is very important. Launder in cold water only, lay flat to dry and store folded. The knit structure, is more of an “open stitch”, which is more susceptible to snags. Thick yarn and open stitching can be susceptible to fiber “pilling”. Be sure to hand wash or machine wash (delicate cycle) with similar items to keep structure and fiber integrity intact. This sweater is a very reasonably priced, high quality, wardrobe classic that will last a lifetime, if properly cared for. Read more",

        "body": "The Amazon Essentials Women's 100% Cotton Crewneck Cable Sweater is a wardrobe staple that I absolutely love! The sweater is made from soft, breathable cotton that feels great against the skin and is perfect for layering in cooler weather. The cable knit pattern adds a classic touch, making it versatile for both casual and slightly dressier occasions. The fit is true to size, and the crewneck design is both comfortable and flattering. It washes well without losing shape or color. Overall, it’s a great quality sweater at an affordable price. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a reliable and stylish cotton sweater! Read more",

        "body": "I've been looking at all cotton cable knit sweaters at some name brands that cost a lot more than this one, and I honestly don't see a difference in quality. This is a classy, flattering sweater that can be dressed up or down, doesn't pill and retains its color nicely after washing. I knew cotton wouldn't be fluffy like cashmere or poly/acrylic, which tend to pill like crazy, so I'm not sure what other reviewers were expecting from a cotton sweater. It is still soft and comfortable, not at all scratchy, but definitely cottony feeling. I'm short and small on top with average shoulders, and the small was a perfect, flattering fit without being boxy, tight or too long. Read more",

I want to tuck it but it won’t lie flat, so it adds bulk. I want to roll the sleeves, but it’s thick cuffs and looks bulky. I wish something seemed slimming or styleable, but it’s not jiving. I wish it were a v-neck or a curved hemline so I could more easily wear with leggings or skinny jeans. But the length as it is just cuts me in half at my widest point which isn’t flattering. That’s why I wanted to tuck it. Going to return the two colors I bought. Read more",
