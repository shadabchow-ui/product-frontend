        "body": "I bought this dress for a small backyard wedding & it was perfect. Light and cool, but still elegant enough for such a special occasion. The top makes it easy to fit different body types, and it stays up well without being super tight. The fabric isn’t sheer at all as the ruffled skirt offers extra coverage. I wore this dress all day with ease as it’s very comfortable. Fabric is lightweight so I didn’t get hot even with all the ruffles. Fit is very flattering even on my short frame. For reference I’m 4’9” and normally wear a size SP/4. This dress hit floor length for me without heels. Read more",

I thought value was good for price point. Arrived horrendously wrinkled and I wasn’t going to have time to iron before the event I wanted to use it for. I ultimately returned after going with a different option but I believe this could be great for anyone who loves the layered skirt look. Read more",

It photographed beautifully NOT SEE THROUGH & flows light weight and had such a flattering fit without being over the top.

        "body": "Bought this for a friend's wedding and added a belt and a blazer for weather purposes. Considering they show it with a belt as possible in the listing, feels like they know it's better with a belt. Wish one came with it. But the thick black one I added looked great. And it covers the somewhat cheap looking seam where the bust piece meets the skirt. It's the main reason I docked a star. That and the material. It's fine. Thin though. I mean, I paid $48. That's not a ton, but it's not nothing. You shouldn't expect something top of the line. But it totally worked for the wedding I was going to. That said, it wrinkles VERY easily. Washes fine. Didn't shrink. Very comfortable to wear. Flattering where the waist line is. And the color was true to the listing. As for sizing... I'm a size 10-12 in bottoms and a L in tops usually, so I bought the L (which said it was for sizes 12-14.) I think I could have fit in the M, but I liked that it fit very comfortably. If you want it crazy tight and your sizing jumps around like mine does based on the product, go down a size. I recommend it. But have realistic expectations. Read more",
