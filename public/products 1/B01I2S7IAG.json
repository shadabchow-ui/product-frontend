        "body": "I’m so on the fence about this dress. First of all, it’s a lot shorter than I expected. I’m 5’6” and the lowest button is about halfway down my jean zipper (so above the crotch). I was planning on wearing it with leggings anyways so not a total deal breaker but was looking for it to be a tad longer. The pockets are also placed pretty high. They’re in the front and are right at waist level. I don’t like the way the dress looks without a belt, not flattering at all for my figure but with the belt the pockets are kind of tucked under it a bit and draw attention to my lower belly area a bit which is NOT a place I want to accentuate. I weigh about 190 and usually wear a size 12 or a large but I’m also a 38D so a little wide in the back and pretty busty. I bought an XL and I could’ve even gone bigger. It’s not tight in the back but the chest pulls a bit. I like it better open with a cami under it so again, that’s ok. The material is pretty thick, but not very soft. Might get better with washing but I don’t know if I’d dry this, it might shrink too much. I’ll probably get some gf opinions on it and then decide if it should go back or not. Read more",

        "body": "Safe to say I'm obsessed now. I have the green and the red buffalo plaids, and the pink. I absolutely LOVE these dresses; they are just the right weight for fall into winter. I've worn both a couple of times now, and received lots of compliments from across the board each time. I wear them with opaque black tights and knee boots, and add a belt to visually cinch the middle a little bit, but it looks great even without a belt. And they have POCKETS!! I had gotten the green initially in a size M, which fit great at my waist but, as I expected, a little too snug in the bust. I wear this one with a tank or cami underneath and leave the first several buttons undone. I then ordered the red in a size L, that one I was able to button with no pulling at the bust. I also ordered the pink in L, but this one is snug in the bust area too, so I wear with a cami. I am having a hard time resisting another color. For reference. I am 40/35/41, 5'3.5\", 160 lbs. The front center of the hi-lo hem hits about 2\" above my knees, so I'd wear tights, and imagine taller people would as well if wearing as a dress, which the long side and back hems allow you to do. If you're busty, size up. Cute, comfortable, fun to wear, flattering. Get one! Read more",

I bought the XL and am glad I did for the fit in the shoulders and bust, but waist wise I probably could have gone with a Large. I wear it with a belt and I like the look. For me, it's too short in front to wear without leggings/tights, but with leggings it is a great fall outfit. The blue is really rich. I am taking off a star because the sleeves are a little short (I wear them rolled up) and because the pockets are useless. They're tiny and in the front, just at the height where I wear a belt, so they're basically un-usable. I love a dress with pockets, and it's one of the reasons I bought this one, so I was disappointed that I can't put my hand sin them or use them to carry things. I'm considering trying to alter the dress to add some pockets on the side seam. All in all, cute dress but if you're looking for a dress where you can put your hands in the pockets, this isn't the one. Read more",
