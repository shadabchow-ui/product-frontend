        "body": "Had to get a last minute dress for a friend’s wedding and Amazon came through hunny!!! The dress is long! I had on probably a 4 inch heel and still had to hold the dress up to walk. I’m short (4”11) so the split was at a good spot. Dress was comfortable and it was nice style for the occasion. I ordered a large and it was very form fitting. My husband loved it also and actually helped me decide on this versus two others I had. Good quality and price. Please note, the dress is an emerald green but appears a differs color under certain shades of light (just in case you trying to match for pictures.) Read more",

The fabric was thin and stretchy. but because it was black it wasn't see through. She wanted a train which it had. It's pretty long but she wanted it that way. The slit is on the side but that didn't bother her. She did wear pretty high stoledos with it. And it was still long. She had to kind of hold her dress when walking. It was perfect form fitting. I would say true to size. If you went a size down for her I think it would be too tight. She's 5'3 and about 180 pounds. For the most part her arm sleeves stayed in place. she said when dancing she had to pick them up a couple times but nothing, to wear she was annoyed. Good product for the price. I gave it a 4 only because she had to pick up the arm sleeves at times but I'd recommend this dress. Read more",
