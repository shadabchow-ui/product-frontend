        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Elegant optical pleats, but thin fabric needs layering",
        "body": "The media could not be loaded. This ZESICA long sleeve sweater dress is a gorgeous piece, especially in the orange red with white contrast hemline. The pleating in the skirt is actually an optical trick created by the weave, which is brilliant — it gives the look of pleats without the hassle, making the dress easy to wash, iron, and wear. I ordered my usual medium, and it fits perfectly. That said, the unlined sweater material is quite thin. It shows every curve — whether you like it or not — and it also reveals bra straps and panty lines. To keep the look polished, some sort of shaper or slip is necessary. I paired mine with a white blazer, which helped conceal undergarment lines, added warmth, and elevated my office look to executive level. The dress itself sparkles in versatility: flattering fit; soft, comfortable fabric; elegant design; and effortless styling for weddings, cocktail parties, or work. With the right layering, it transitions beautifully from day to evening. And at this price, it’s a true value find — stylish, well‑made, and accessible without sacrificing elegance. Read more",
