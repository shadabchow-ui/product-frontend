        "body": "This is everything I was looking for in a classy black dress that would be suitable for somber or conservative occasions. It's perfect for a funeral or meeting the Pope. I think 3/4 sleeves are universally flattering, and the midi length is quite elegant. The notched neckline is flanked by two little pleats that add dimension and interest. The fabric has some stretch but isn't clingy. It is forgiving of any lumps or bumps you may have. If you are short waisted, the inset waist seam should be just right for you. Us long waisted gals are used to having the waist seam ride up on our bottom ribs. I always try to hide that with a stretchy belt. The side zipper is a bit of challenge to navigate, especially through the bulkier waist seam area, but it is manageable. I'm 5' 6'' and about 125 lb. I usually wear an extra small in dresses but found this XS to be just a bit too tight in the bodice and the upper arms. I ordered the small and it's a perfect fit. I think this is going to be a wardrobe workhorse and for a fantastic price. I've ordered a couple more in different colors. Read more",

        "body": "I wasn’t expecting luxury at this price point, so in that sense, you get what you pay for. The dress looked cute in the photo, but in person, the material felt cheap and the fit was very boxy (kind of like a potato sack).

        "body": "So happy with this dress. I typically wear a size 2 in a dress and the XS fit me perfectly. The material is a medium weight crepe polyester (with 5% spandex that does not provide stretch - but that was not problem for me). The dress hangs very well and on me (5'4\" / 29.5\" inseam), the hem hit about two inches below my knee. It arrives folded in plastic bag so you will need to iron or steam out some wrinkles before wearing. I used a steamer and the wrinkles were easy to release. I bought this for a Fall funeral because it's understated. But, it can be easily dressed up for a party or date. Nice size side pockets too. Read more",

It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.",
