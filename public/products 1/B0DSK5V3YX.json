I normally wear a size 10-12, but bought this in a XL because I wanted it to hang nicely without being too tight around my belly. I am about 5'4\" and the length was long but worked well with my 3-4\" heels. If you are a bit shorter or don't wear high heels, I would recommend you size down. It's unbelievable for the price too. It came a tiny bit wrinkled but I was able to get the wrinkles out easily with the steam function on my iron. Read more",
