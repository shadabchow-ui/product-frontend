The skirt swooshes in a way that makes it look more elegant and expensive than it is. A bit long, though! Really should have had it hemmed but I skated by bc my heels were so high. Was stopped all night at the wedding by women complimenting the dress and asking where I got it. Heads up on the sheerness factor of the beige panels, though! Could not wear my thigh-length shape-wear bc it was totally visible. But skin-toned underwear-style shape-wear worked fine! Also, there is padding in the shoulders that would give you a more structured, angular silhouette if you’re thinner/smaller in the arms-collarbone. I’m pretty round so it didn’t do much, but just a heads up! Wish I had a video so you could see the way the skirt moves bc it is SO FUN! Read more",
