        "body": "I wasn’t totally sure how this sweater dress would look on me, but wow—I ended up loving it! The knit is soft and stretchy without being clingy in a bad way, and the turtleneck gives it that cozy, put-together vibe. It’s warm enough for chilly days but not so heavy that you overheat indoors. The bodycon fit is flattering but still comfortable, and the midi length makes it easy to dress up or down. I’ve worn it with boots for work and with sneakers for a more casual weekend look. It holds its shape well. I bought this in 2023 and still wear it regularly in the fall and winter. If you want something that feels like a comfy sweater but looks like you actually tried—this is it. Great value and super cute! Read more",

        "body": "I bought black knowing from other reviews that it would be a dark grey. I did still hope it might be black, but I'm not disappointed. It's fairly dark and just slightly warm of neutral, it goes well with black clothes, as well as colors. The XL fits me perfect, and is my usual clothing size. I'm 5'8\" and 210lbs. It's not cotton, as other reviews have pointed out, but for this price that's unsurprising. Maybe it used to be or maybe some colors still are. It's slightly itchy but not in a way that's a problem to me, ymmv. I threw it in a normal wash and dryer on low and it came out fine, so I'll be buying another color now that I know I don't have to air dry it or anything. Also for all that it's tight and shows off shape, it's not uhhh nipple-y for lack of another phrasing. My photos are without a bra. I bought it largely to have something comfy and easy to throw on at home and not have to worry about running out to check the mail or unexpected guests, so that's the biggest win for this dress for me.

        "body": "Classic sweater dress and the cable pattern continues on the back. Nice length for my 5’8” height. I ordered the khaki and navy. Khaki has a nice neutral tone that can go with browns or grays. The blue is navy but when the light catches it it takes on a more royal blue hue. In my opinion the color is due to the yarn being more of a “heather” which may make darker colors appear lighter. Although it was beautiful I ended up returning the blue because it seemed to attract lint. I kept the khaki and wore it as pictured. Received one genuine compliment and another person said I was “brave.” Not sure what that meant but I was already feeling a little self conscious about the body con fit. I wish the cut didn’t taper at the bottom but would come straight down from the hips that way I wouldn’t feel like I have to stand posing all the time. At 60 I needed to wear smoothing undergarments. I may order another in a size large to compare the fit. Otherwise it fit perfect through the shoulders. I measure 36/28/39 and typically wear a size 8/medium. I purchased the medium. The neck is very long (fortunately I have a long neck) the knit is a good warm weight and not too scratchy - just the seam around the neck was slightly scratchy on my collar bone and inside forearms but not terrible.

        "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars \"Black\" is NOT black. Itchy for sensitive skin",
        "body": "Overall, I DO RECOMMEND this dress, I think it's very cute and comfy if you have less sensitive skin. Just don't buy the black unless you want dark forest green. Also be aware, it's a little fragile. Details: Have included both an indoor and an outdoor photo as well as a fabric color comparison to a dress I actually considered to be black. Be aware, depending on your screen settings and brightness the green color may not come across exact, however the comparison should be able to show that the dress is not black in most screen conditions. The fabric is perfect thickness. Warm in 40°F, but thin enough to be comfortable indoors, even for warmer bodies. Unfortunately, if you have sensitive skin, it's very itchy. After only a days use, it started it pill really bad in one spot, likely from my hand bag, so layering is questionable. I held a non aggressive cat for approximately 3 seconds and it got two runs in it which happens and was my own fault, but if I can't pet a cat because of my dress, that dress loses a point, of course! Many similar fabrics are run resistant, otherwise I wouldn't mention my folly. So you must be very careful when washing or wearing. I never washed it. I was scared to put runs in it from the washer and intended to return it. The \"Black\" color is not black at all. If I had to pick a gray scale it's closer to a Charcoal gray, but even then it leans really undesirably into the Forest or Olive Green area. Two people I met that day commented on my \"green\" dress. Though, to be fair, they both said they liked my green dress! I am 5'7\" and 210 lbs and ordered an XL. The fit was perfect, the thicker fabric was very flattering even on someone with a bit of tummy fluff, and it pairs perfectly with a long peacoat. I still might get it again in a different color, likely the navy or green (but on purpose this time). This is still the best sweater dress I've encountered on Amazon so far. Read more",

This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Blue, Dark Grey, Purple Red, Army Green, Black, Navy Blue, Orange, Khaki, Pink, Beige, Purple, Green, Grey. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
