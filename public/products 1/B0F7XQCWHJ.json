The soft ribbed fabric has a nice stretch and drapes really well without clinging in a weird way. I love the higher t-shirt style neckline. It gives a clean, polished look and makes it feel a little more elevated than a basic dress. The fit is comfortable with just enough shape through the waist, and the length works perfectly with tights and boots for fall and winter. It’s warm without being bulky and super easy to style. Honestly, it’s one of those dresses you can throw on and feel instantly put together. Would absolutely buy another color. Read more",
