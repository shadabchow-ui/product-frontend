        "body": "I ordered a Medium originally. It was great quality, nice thick and soft material, cute pattern, but ran exceptionally large. I'm 5'6 130 lbs and typically wear a small or medium, and like my sweaters loose, but this was way too long and wide. I reordered an XS. It fit perfectly, but...the quality was not comparable.

  "short_description": "Womens Dress is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.\n\nIf you are between sizes, choose based on how close you like the fit through the waist and hips, then adjust with your usual layering choices.",
