        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Flattering, Stretchy, and Comfortable!",
        "body": "5'6\", 140lbs, 34in bust, 29in waist, 37in hips. Medium fit me perfectly. Lake blue color matches the image. Beautiful, comfortable dress for a great price and doesn't look cheap. Very flattering, not particularly restrictive, and somewhat versatile. Worn to a wedding, but I can see myself wearing it on a date, to a club, to a Broadway show, and for other special events. The straps can be worn up or down. I'll probably buy this dress in another color later. I love the comfortably stretchy, light, and airy material that hugs my curves without feeling tight or looking loose. I especially love the way it accentuates my hips. The fabric feels nice and doesn't irritate my skin. My lacy strapless bra isn't visible from the front or back. The ripples of the fabric easily masks lines from undergarments and shapewear. As for the length, it stops about 3 inches below my knees. I have no problem with it slipping down at all. I can dance freely without discomfort from the dress and have full range of motion with my arms, though not nearly as much with my legs. No issues with stains or tears, as a couple other reviewers mentioned. Overall, I highly recommend this dress! Read more",

        "body": "I’ve been searching for the perfect dress to wear as a wedding guest for weeks—tried countless options at the mall and walked away empty-handed every time. I finally turned to Amazon and came across this beautiful dress, and I’m SO glad I did! I ordered it last night and was shocked when it arrived by 6am this morning. Naturally, I tried it on right away—and I couldn’t stop smiling! The fit is absolutely perfect, and the material feels high quality and looks so flattering on. I was especially impressed by the rubber strip along the top to keep it in place—no sliding down! The off-the-shoulder cap sleeves add such a lovely, elegant touch. I’m attending a wedding in Mexico where it’ll be hot, and this dress feels like the ideal choice—lightweight, breathable, stylish, and comfortable. For reference, I’m 5'5\", 130 lbs, and ordered a Medium. I probably could’ve gone with a Small for a snugger fit, but since I have a fuller bust, the Medium was a safe (and flattering) choice. This dress completely exceeded my expectations—I’m already thinking of ordering more colors. Highly recommend! Read more",

        "body": "I wore this dress to a formal wedding in Cabo, and I absolutely loved it. It’s very cute and flattering — the style worked beautifully for the event, and I received several compliments. The fabric and fit felt comfortable, which made the night more enjoyable (no fussing or readjusting). It looked elegant enough for a special occasion, while still being comfortable enough to wear through dancing, socializing, and all the wedding festivities. For a dressed-up event without sacrificing comfort, this dress hit the mark. Pros: • Pretty, formal-event-appropriate look — nice enough for a wedding. • Comfortable fit — easy to wear all evening without discomfort. • Felt versatile: elegant but not over the top, so good for both ceremony and reception/party. Cons: I got the same dress, same size in pink and it was not as cute or flattering as the black so if you go for a color I suggest a size up or maybe two sizes up. Overall: If you’re looking for a dress that combines elegance and comfort for a wedding or formal event, this one is a great choice. It made me feel put-together but comfortable — perfect for a celebration night out. Read more",

It has enough stretchiness and bunching in the middle to hide my mom pooch (x’s 3), but still leaves you feeling shapely and attractive. The bold and vibrant blue color was a great choice. The dress fit amazingly, with my typical medium being perfect. The material had a nice texture and was high quality. I would have easily paid more for this dress because it’s similar to what you would find in a high-end retail store. Fantastic purchase! Read more",

The Dress is lined and not see-through. Material doesn’t really wrinkle, so it didn’t need to be steamed! Anti-wrinkle & rouched material makes this a great dress for traveling! Also the rouching helps hide problem areas, so it looks flattering on many body types! Plus the dress is pretty stretchy & overall very comfortable. I loved the green color & highly recommend!
