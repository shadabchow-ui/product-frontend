Sleeves and skirt of dress have a nice oversized flowy feel but sleeves fit securely to forearm. I have mine pulled up in this picture for a puff sleeve look. The dress has pockets which I do not care for since it makes the sides of skirt stick out a tad, but not too noticeable if you flatten them. Overall very cute and free people dupe!

I hand washed it and hung it up to dry. There is a hole in the sleeve, there are a lot of loose strings, and there are a few flowers that don’t have the center sewn in or it’s partially sewn. If you can overlook the small flaws, it’s a cute dress. It fits nicely and it would be flattering on many body types. There is a ton of stretch in the bodice. It’s actually really supportive in the bust. I have a large bust and there’s still tons of stretch. The material is soft and thick enough where you don’t need a slip. I’m 5’5 and it comes to my lower shin. I bought a large. If you decide to buy it, expect to have to treat it really gently. Read more",

        "body": "I ordered this dress 3 times. First in the “Purple” and “Cream” colors - pictures included. The coloring was just wayyyy off from what was shown in the product description pictures. The flowers on the purple dress are bright red. The flowers on the cream dress were a bright green - not at all what I was wanting unfortunately. I returned those two & took a chance and ordered the “Beige” color, thankfully that one actually came in looking like the color pictured! I loved the neutral look of it and wore for my baby shower at 30 weeks pregnant. Size medium fit great. I’m 5’5 & normally 150lb, currently at 180 & it was comfortable and looked great - can’t wait to wear it after pregnancy as well! Another downside was how wrinkled this fabric is. You will definitely want to steam before wearing. Made a huge difference for my dress. Of the 3 I ordered - they were all a bit see through but the “cream” color was by far the most see through! I just wore pregnancy spanx under my dress but would have liked to have a slip ideally. I think it’s a little pricey for what it is (kinda cheaply made, may not hold up super well) but nothing ships faster than an amazon dress and I’m always looking for these things at the last minute, so it was worth it for me!

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Maxi is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: XS, S, M, L, XL.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Sky Blue, Brown, Cream, Rose, Black, Ginger, Navy Blue, Orange, Dark Brown, Dark Red, Dark Green, Light Blue, Pink, Beige. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
