Definitely trust the pics and videos—it looks just like them in real life. I got the brown and just a heads up: it leans more of a warm peachy tone in person, not a flat brown. But honestly, I love it even more because of that. Really cute, flattering fit with the smocking and flowy skirt. Great dress overall! Size down, I usually float between small and medium, and this dress is roomy, so if you're like me go with the smaller size. Read more",

The fabric feels high-quality yet lightweight, and it’s not see-through. The style is incredibly flattering, with ruffled wide straps, a square neckline and back, a ribbed fitted top, pockets, and a flowing skirt. I also love that it works beautifully as a maternity dress. So versatile, you can easily dress it up or down. I loved it so much, I bought it in two colors! I’ve gotten so many compliments.

        "body": "I always look for reviews with pictures because they’re helpful, so I hope this one helps! Really pretty dress. I ordered a size L based on the sizing guide and it fit perfectly, except the straps — they’re a little loose and the stitching is a bit off (minus one star for that). I’m 5’3” and curvy, and the length is just right, even with flats. The fabric feels nice and good quality. The color is a warm peachy-orange pink. The dress has some flow and fullness, and it’s slightly see-through but not too much. Love the pockets! I’ll update after the first wash and dry, but overall I’d definitely buy again. Wore it for Halloween and got so many compliments (updated- washed and dry on low and it seems like fabric has shrunk a few inches) Read more",

One of my favorite features is that it has pockets, which makes it both cute and practical. The material is lightweight but not see-through at all in the black and white plaid, which is a huge plus. I also recommend sizing down if you’re between sizes, since it runs a little roomy. Easy to dress up with sandals and jewelry or wear casually—definitely a versatile summer maxi dress that I’ll be wearing often. Read more",
