        "body": "This dress was so figure flattering and comfortable to wear. The material has tons of stretch (think swimsuit) and breathes well in the heat. There is a lot of elastic in the upper portion of the dress and because of the gathering, you can bunch it up and hide the problem areas. It has a drop waist for a down-to-your ankles look or you could lift higher for a shorter dress length. Be aware that the bottom part is fairly sheer though. Im 5’4” and about 140 lbs with a large bust and the Medium fit perfect. The dress looks and feels elegant and flowy without being too suggestive. I loved wearing it. My husband said is was so pretty 😍 Read more",

Maybe I got it too big? The length is perfect if I had heels. But the picture of the girl has the top fabric sit way more above (which I wanted) than what I received. It’s not very forgiving on the curves as shown (which I’m ok with, but some people may not like that). In my last pic, I showed what it should look like with the top fabric sitting higher, but I don’t prefer the ruffles/ruche going on. I also was excited about the asymmetrical slant thing going on, but that barely existed on me. Just wanted to show how long the top part of the fabric is on me, because it’s much higher on the girl and I’m “taller”. Returning. I wish I loved this dress because it is beautiful. Read more",

I pulled the dress up and made it gather at the waist. My heels are about 3 or 4 inches and the length was perfect after pulling it up. It looks like something you could buy from Zara or even free people. The top of the dress is double, if not triple layered. I was expecting it to be very thin at the top, but I was impressed with its thickness! The shear “boho” zebra print layer is so pretty. I love that it’s semi see through on the bottom, and the slit is very flattering. I was worried about the top of it staying up because most strapless tops/dresses tend to fall and I always have to pull it up. Didn’t have to with this one! Would be great for bachelorette parties, summer/early fall weddings, date nights and anytime you need a long dress and don’t want to spend $$$. Sorry the picture is blurry! I took a screenshot of a video. Read more",
