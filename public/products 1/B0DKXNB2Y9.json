The versatility of this dress is amazing because i wore it to a wedding (got so so so many compliments) and danced allll night while also looking formal and comfortable and i can also wear it for date night or girls night out. The only thing i would note r that the straps i felt were slightly thin but they did not break for me personally. however if u r a larger chested person i would recommend taking that into consideration. however the dress held up well with stretchiness and comfort being the main favorite take aways Read more",

The quality is amazing, it's stretchy, the length is perfect for my 5'3\" self, the color alone is such a cute yellow, and it holds up the girls w/o needing a push up or anything else! The smaller strap that goes across the back is also adjustable which helps hug your waist! The only con I have for this dress is that in enough light, you could see my thong.

I was quite pleased with the dress quality. HOWEVER, there was a strange pinch of extra material at the hips. It was so strange. In order for this dress to work, you would really need to be quite pear shaped with an extra large hip area to fill in the extra material. And I'd say size down. The dress ran a little big.
