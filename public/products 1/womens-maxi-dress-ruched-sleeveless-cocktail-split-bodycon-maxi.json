But I’m not super upset about it, cause I’m returning and ordering a different size anyway because I didn't like how the XXL fit up top. I just hope the next one isn’t stained cause I don’t have that much time until my event where I wanted to wear this dress!!** -My honest review would be 5 stars, because this dress is beautiful! Definitely doesn’t fit larger boobs in the same way it would with the material hanging down in front… So that’s kind of a bummer. But it’s still stretchy, comfy, and cute. Formal and comfy as heck. I did put some bathing suit inserts in the top so my nipples wouldn’t show through. They stayed in place just fine with the XL when I tried it on. I ordered the rust color to see how I’d like it (pictured) in a size XL, in this picture I’m 5’9”, about 220lbs and 30 weeks pregnant. Fit nicely everywhere! (Besides the material that’s supposed to hang on the boobs) but I think this look is just fine. I wanted to actually get one in a teal color (Lake Blue) for my baby shower next month (I will be 36 weeks at the time) so I ordered an XXL just to see the difference in size since I’ll be bigger, but I think I might still stick with the XL though cause there is extra wiggle room up top with this one and they’re so stretchy I think I can get away with my bump being bigger in it! Hope this helps y'all, it’s a cute ass dress. Just check for stains! Read more",
