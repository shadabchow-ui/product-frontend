        "body": "I am in love with this dress! I’m going to buy every color! It’s the perfect dreamy effortless dress. I love wearing it around the house and out and about. I feel like a romantic novel heroine or Victorian ghost floating around the house in this. Whether I’m running errands, cooking, reading or just rotting on the couch watching tv I feel put together and feminine. It has a very old world Victorian/regency charm to the design in my opinion. Perfect for those who love historic fashion but still want something practical. The neckline is a perfect v, low enough to feel a little flirty but not plunging. It may not fit as nicely on more busty women though. Perfect for us itty bitty ladies. The sleeves are a little bit long and the ruffle covers half my hand but I love it, it adds to that vintage feminine historical charm. The skirt is very full and is the perfect length. Just barely hovers above the floor (I’m 5’3 and ordered a size small) it is very flattering and shows your curves at the right angles and hides them in others giving a mysterious feminine allure. My husband loves it. Very versatile and would be maternity friendly. The color is very close to the picture, a very pretty Victorian rose pink. Read more",

It fit fine around the bust when I first put it on, but after moving around a little bit it just looked a little funny. Super pretty though!

        "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars Turn it Around!",
        "body": "A couple positives about this dress. It is very soft. I'm not sure what I was expecting. So often these purchases are hit or miss. This one, however, had a softness and was, to me, a beautiful fabric. I received the Mauve/Dusty Rose shade and I love it. I am a bigger girl and very leary of the brands that only go up to a XL or, sometimes even a XXL. Again, it is typical with these purchases for the need to be sizing up. I am 5' 3.5\" tall/269lbs./ Big Breasts, Small Waist/ Larger Hips & Thighs. I don't know what possessed me to order this as it only goes to an XL. I am glad I took the chance though. It is generously sized below the waist and fit my larger lower half beautifully. It does not cling and flows softly with a perfect BoHo feel. BUT, if you are a larger breasted woman, as I am, you will find this dress does not fit well in that area. I am a 38G - it wasn't happening. Given this you have 2 choices. 1. Wear it as it is meant to be. This will leave a bit of a shapeless silhouette. The elastic/ruching will end up a bit above your breasts - a bit like more towards your shoulders. It doesn't look awful if your are ok missing out on the Empire style that gives it some definition. OR 2. Turn this dress around & wear it backwards! That's my choice. There are no tags in the dress so there is nothing to either irritate your skin or struggle to cut out. This worked well for me. The neck comes a little high but not in an uncomfortable way. It just won't give a peek of decolletage. It gives more of a waist level definition from the front as opposed to Empire. But, what I found I loved was the sexy little V it gave in back. So many times a V back is way too low for me because it shows my bra but this was perfect. If you are on the fence about, give it a try. I'd say 8 out of 10 you will find a way to wear that is comfortable for you. Read more",

The length was perfect (5’4” size L) hit top of feet and the elastic cuffs are not tight so very comfortable. I have the same issue as other reviews stated that the chest area doesn’t stay in place. I like it better down where it’s supposed to be but if you have this issue it doesn’t look bad letting it be up above your chest as more decorative ruching under the collar bone. It will stop you from going crazy constantly pulling it down. Someone had a great idea of pinning it in place and I’m going to try this. Material is very nice and this color is not see-thru. I definitely recommend and will be buying another color. If you’re under 5’4 it may be a little long unless you’re wearing heels. Read more",
