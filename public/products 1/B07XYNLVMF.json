        "body": "I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this dress! It fit perfectly. I ordered the 3X although I normally wear 2X just because I wasn't sure if the fabric was stretchy. It does have a little stretch to it but the 3X still worked. As a top-heavy apple shape, the smidge extra room made a difference. The fabric was a bright cotton blend, not heavy but not see through. The dress is lined so it's super comfy. I walked a parade in it and it was perfectly comfortable. It has a nice flow although I did buy a petticoat to maximize the 50s look. I also added a jaunty witch hat with a small veil, lace gloves and a wand for a witchy vintage vibe. I've washed it twice and it still looks great. I'm super sad to pack it in storage and can't wait for next year. I'll definitely buy others in different colors. Get a Christmas design lol! Read more",

        "body": "The sizing came as described, which was great. A medium wouldn't fit my waist, but a large was a bit too generous on top, so I got the large. I am 5'6\" 150lbs. The waist is not tight, but not loose. It likely will fit perfect after it's been washed. The top however was incredibly generous...I wear a 34D, I had a good 2-4 inches of too much space on the top. I was able to snip the single stitch holding the bodice closed and fold down the edges of the bodice to make a smaller cup size. Now it has a much nicer fit that only took a few minutes of my time to adjust. The fabric feels nice and sturdy with no stretch. The green plaid is dark and vibrant, just how I wanted it to be. The pockets are positioned well and feel like they will be useful to hold me car keys and wallet. They might be just a bit short for my phone though. The zipper sticks a little, but I've yet to find a zipper that doesn't. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and I may consider buying another in a different fabric color. This is just the right length for the office, and I can throw on a pair of shorts for my morning commute on my bike without worrying about the skirt getting caught in the wheels. I feel, come winter time, it will also pair cutely with some tall wool socks for warmth. Read more",

        "body": "I really love this dress but I’m only giving it 4 stars because of the fabric. It’s definitely a cheaper thin scratchy cotton blend. Wrinkles extremely easily. But it is beautiful on once it’s ironed. I would say this dress is more for bustier women. I’m pretty average at a 34d bra size and I just barely filled the chest out. The pockets are a nice addition but they sat a little high on me to comfortably use them. The color was fabulous and I got tons of compliments on the dress when I wore it. Read more",

It’s a little on the stiff side but I haven’t washed it yet the material is pretty thin and feels like it’ll be very comfortable to wear in the summer time, I was a little hesitant about the idea of having to try to zip it up but the zipper was relatively smooth. It’s a very slimming, I’m 5’1 and around 200lbs and you can’t tell I have much of a belly in the dress at all! I honestly am so excited and happy with this purchase for the price it’s definitely worth it!

        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Mid-century captured in a beautiful well made dress! Look at how pretty it is!",
        "body": "Hi! Look at me.... I have lost over 115 pounds, and met my goal, so I thought I'd treat myself to a pretty new dress. Mom always said yellow was a great color for me, and I believe it! I usually never have a photo for my reviews, but this dress was SO nice, I just had to include one so you guys could see for yourselves. First off, it is a nice light cotton dress, perfect for hot summers here in Florida! I'm sorry I did not iron it before the photo--- I took it out of the packaging and put it on right away! I know when I iron it, it is going to be even more gorgeous! The cotton is not heavy, but not thin and cheap either. See how the bodice is made, with that pretty pleated overlapping sewing they did? It's beautiful! There is a zipper at the back. A very nice cute little dainty yellow colored zipper pull, to match the dress. Stitched in perfectly! I have lost enough weight that I am now able to pull the zipper pull most of the way up, then reach over my shoulder and finish the zip! For comparison, I am a 55F, 5'4\" inches tall, and I now weigh 175lbs, and Amazon's size chart recommended the size 2x for me, which was almost a perfect fit. Just a wee bit too big. I am sure that when I put my shape-wear on, and buy one size smaller, this dress will be a perfect fit! As it is, it's pretty enough that I can wear it a little bit loose, that is ok! ANNNND------ IT HAS POCKETS, LADIES! POCKETS!! I was SO freakin happy to discover pockets!! They are deep enough to hold my iPhone 12. I'm happy! Also, the pleating is nice. I know once I iron it, it will look amazing. I bet if you got one of those--what do they call it?--a petticoat? It you wore one of those underneath, it would really make this dress flare out like it was meant to flare. Like the way dresses flared in the 50's! I love that mid-century look! Let's see. What else? The length. It was right below my knee, not too short, not too long. Perfect with a pear of kitten heels, or some pretty sandals. I am absolutely impressed with the bodice part though. I've been a large woman all my life, until recently, and I'm still learning what styles fit me best. I lost the weight really fast, and I've always struggled to find stuff that would fit, especially when it came to fitting my chest size. But this dress, look at how amazing it looks. AND it comes in other colors too, some have patterns. I think the plain colors really capture the pretty bodice. I love love love the style of the neck. I don't know the terminology for that kind of look, but it sure looks nice! They really made an effort to make a pretty dress, and they did a great job! I am definitely going to be buying another one, as soon as I get another price drop! I want a closet FULL of this style of dress! Oh, one thing my husband noticed was that even though it is not a thin cotton fabric, it is a little see-through. I had on some darker underclothes, and he could definitely see that. So make sure you wear light colored undergarments with this yellow dress. *As with any new clothes I buy like this, I always make sure to wash it by itself, just in case some of the yellow color might bleed out. Yellow isn't too bad, but darker colors like burgundy, etc, make sure you wash the separately! And after it's been in the dryer, hang immediately, to prevent wrinkles. I have a steam iron--I will try it out and see how that works before I put the real iron to it. I don't see any loose threads, or any stitches that look wonky, so I would like to give this dress 5 out of 5 stars. Read more",
