This dress is a bit thick, but still appropriate in the summer! It also makes a great lounging dress or you can even sleep in it! It is so sexy, and you can wear it comfortably off one shoulder or off both. It works great! I don't often write reviews and I am REALLY picky. I bought this in every color. If you have big boobs, it is not too revealing but still feels like you could wear it out without flaunting yourself. Ignore the picture. It is not that extreme if you are big up top. Read more",

        "body": "Now there are so many dresses like this on Amazon and choosing one could be difficult and most times we tend to rely on reviews and sometimes we may not get enough or satisfactory information so let me see if I can help. First of all my measurements are bust 41 inches waist 36 and my hips are 45 inches I'm 5'4. This dress the fabric is not to thick and not at all thin. It's actually just looks rick, black and perfect for spring or fall and the length falls just at my ankles which btw I was hoping for. the sleeves are very comfortable and I have a bit thick arms, really really comfortable! the length of the sleeves was perfect too. The dress is a deep V front and back and look better off the shoulder than on and it stays put. I felt very comfortable with movement as the dress contoured my curves without being extremely tight and uncomfortable it also narrow at the bottom giving you that shapely silhouette. I bought an XL and it's the size I would normally wear. Hope this helps you guys. It's a fantastic dress. You won't be disappointed! Read more",

It’s nice for everybody’s size if you have curved soldier curves very well I definitely recommend it’s stretchy. It’s a nice material is very soft. I ordered it because I was taking photos for my son’s birthday birthday and it came out very nice. I would highly recommend for anybody. Any size the color on my behalf, I didn’t like the green, but the color therefore anybody who wants that green color, my behalf, I like the black, but I do highly recommend. I was just unsatisfied that they sat here and gave me the green one when I had ordered the black so I had to order this twice. Read more",

I decide to stay in theme with green or pink, going with green since that's my favorite color. I was wary to order this address. But I saw reviews of women a bit larger than myself that said it fit them perfectly. So I took a chance, and i'm so glad that I did. This dress is absolutely beautiful. It goes all the way down to Your calves and then some. There's a little bit of elastic around the shoulder part, and it stays around your shoulders and doesn't roll up or down, which is perfect for somebody like me, a big back with linebacker shoulders😭😭 It's not see through and of a decent thickness, and is a good strong knit. I also appreciate the streps to tie around your midsection so the dress doesn't look so flat and bland and draw a lot of attention to your belly, if you have one like me lol. It's also very comfortable, yet hugs you in all the right places. I'm going to order this dress in more colors!💚💚💚 Read more",
