        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Finally, A Maxi Dress That Understands Curves! (Detailed Fit Review)",
        "body": ": Yes As a curvy woman (5'2\", 215 lbs) with significant hips and thighs, finding a maxi dress that fits both my waist and my curves without looking like a tent or being too short is a constant struggle. This Runwind dress is a rare and wonderful exception. I am absolutely thrilled with it. Fit & Comfort (The Big Win!): I ordered my usual size based on the size chart, and it fit perfectly. The magic is in the cut. It has just the right amount of stretch in the fabric to accommodate my hips without being tight or restrictive. The waist is defined but not constricting, and the skirt flows beautifully away from the body, skimming over my hips and thighs rather than clinging to them. It’s incredibly comfortable to wear and move in. For my fellow \"hippy\" big girls: this dress gets it. You will feel supported and flattered, not squeezed. Fabric & Quality: The fabric is a mid-weight jersey that feels soft and durable. It’s opaque—no need for a slip, which is a huge plus. The material has enough structure to hold its shape all day but enough stretch to be forgiving. The POCKETS! This was the deal-closer for me. The side pockets are deep, functional, and perfectly placed. They don't drag the dress down or look bulky. I can comfortably hold my phone, lipstick, and even my hands without worrying about anything falling out. It’s such a practical and thoughtful feature that so many dresses lack. Style & Details: The design is elegant and modest without being frumpy. The sleeves are a perfect length, the neckline is classic, and I was pleasantly surprised that the length was a true maxi on my 5'2\" frame—it hit right at the top of my feet. It’s a versatile piece that feels both stylish and appropriate for a formal setting. The stitching is even and secure, and it came out of the wash looking brand new (I followed the cold wash/tumble dry low instructions). Final Thoughts: This dress is a home run. It solved the classic curvy-girl problem with grace, style, and POCKETS! It’s well-made, comfortable, and truly flattering. If you’ve been hesitant to try a maxi dress for fear of fit issues, this is the one to take a chance on. I followed the size chart precisely, and it worked perfectly for me. I will definitely be buying this in other colors. Highly, highly recommend Read more",

The shoulder width is excellent for my wide shoulders. The arms are comfortably slightly loose on my bat wings. The buttons lay flat and closed, no gapping or pulling (40DD). The bodice length could be a few inches longer, after my bust takes up space. The seam line hovers bellow bust level, but not at my waist. I choose not to use the matching fabric belt. Instead, I use a wide, patterned scarf as a belt and use small safety pins to hold it covering the seam location. The skirt has plenty of space for free movement, not body skimming. The length on me is s at my ankle.(5'7\") If you are at far end of height either way consider if this will work for you. The fabric is a nice, breathable mid weight. I have no trouble with the top being see through. I chose to use a long half slip on the bottom. There is some see-through on the bottom. The slip solvea this, but the pockets (yes, it has pockets!) are a bit visible through. My dress is the solid yellow... darker of patterned fabrics may not have this issue. I'm as pale as you can get. Skin tone and choice on undergarments may impact the see-through issue. Overall, a nice dress for the price. Read more",
