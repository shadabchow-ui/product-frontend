        "body": "This is one of my favorite dresses. It is comfortable, a stretchy woven material, certainly a more casual fabric. Because it is stretchy it has a lot of give when it comes to sizing. I ordered a small and am 5’5” and about 120 pounds and it certainly would fit someone a size up from me as well, it clung to me without feeling skin tight. I wore it to a bridal shower and then to a wedding reception with a cocktail dress code. It is light and breathable, but not see though. It is a midi length, and the ruching on the side is very flattering. I always get compliments on the color. I am on the pale side with darker blonde hair and blue eyes, I have never been told more that something is “my color”. It is good for mild seasons as it is breathable, but fitted and long. I got a little chilling wearing inside in the evening but never felt too warm in the sun. I have worn it about 3-4 times to evens and machine washed it each time and it has held up well and so has the color. Read more",

I had to return it. I’m married and in my 40s. Couldn’t have my nips showing panty line or shapewear showing and the way it hugged my little pooch was too much lol. My husband said I could wear it in the house but it was too much for a family party 😂😂 The fit was flattering though. Just wrong material. Maybe a darker color would have worked but do not get light colors. The cut of the dress just doesn’t match the material. It’s a covered but very sexy look if that’s your thing. Read more",
