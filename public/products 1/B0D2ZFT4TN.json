I never have an issue where dresses are too short since I’m short, they are usually too long. Not sure how much longer the bigger sizes might be but if you’re over like 5’2 max and getting a size small just know it will be very short. It’s a really soft/silky material and super stretchy. I probably would’ve gotten an extra small had they had it for it to be a little more fitted around my waist (but obviously then it would’ve been even shorter, so that wouldn’t have worked). The black color was not see-through at all and the material is pretty thick, there’s a lining underneath the dress. I think I would have liked it more had both the shoulder straps been thinner. Didn’t work for me but could work for someone! Read more",

I think that if the material was different it would have been a lot more flattering. The stress hugged my curves in all the wrong ways and the shoulder situation is very awkward especially that I have a bigger chest area. The bottom of the dress is more a line and doesn’t really cling to your body which makes the dress feel so much shorter. Overall it is very stretchy and it is thick.
