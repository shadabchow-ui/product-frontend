        "body": "I bought this dress in both the L and XL because I wasn't sure how stretchy it is. I am 5'2\", 38DDD/F cup. The XL fit my bust best, covering my bra adequately. However, it was loose through the waist, hips, and the mesh overlay sagged due to being too loose. The L fit everywhere very well, wasn't too short, but the bust didn't cover as well. I chose the L. I didn't mind because I was wearing it in a dark location, and wore a black bra that blended well. I paired the dress with a long sleeve mesh top (a long sleeve version of this dress would be amazing) to cover my arms, black, sheer stockings, and black velvet chunky heels. I received a lot of compliments on the dress. This dress is very versatile. It could be paired with a leather jacket, fishnets, and combat boots. Or stockings, black velvet stiletto heels, and a velvet opera coat. The dress is stretchy, soft, the right length. Its not thin, nor too thick. It is perfect for all seasons. The material is sturdy, thick, and doesn't feel cheap. Read more",
