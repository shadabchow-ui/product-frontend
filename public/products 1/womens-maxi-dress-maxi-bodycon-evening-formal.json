It flares out at the bottom, but it's not so long that I trip on it. I got size XL. I'm 5'6\" and I weight 166. The material is light and thin but no see thru. Not stretchy. Satin with a pattern.

        "body": "I saw this dress on a website several months ago and fell in love, but it was well over $100. I reversed searched the dress on Amazon, and found this one. I could tell from comparing the photos that it wasn’t a re-creation or knock off, they were the EXACT same dresses. The other was just marked up a lot because it was on an aesthetic website. This is super common, so always reverse search your favorite higher priced items!! It no more or less ethical, because they’re all paying the factories the same amount. Onto the dress itself: the dress is BEAUTIFUL in person but I was surprised by how thin the material was. I wouldn’t say it wrinkles super easily, but it definitely does crease easily, as you can see around my hips and under my bust, where the dress would gather. I’m wearing this dress at 5 months pregnant. The corset back helped me look SNATCHED. I really didn’t look pregnant from the front, but belly was on full display when I turned to the side. As I said, the material is very thin, so it’s not going to really hold you in or do a lot of disguising. I’m larger chested and definitely struggled to keep my cleavage from being too exposed, as the the top would kinda flop open. I think a C or D cup would fit this dress size (Small) best. I’m also 5’2 and wearing tall platform heels. Read more",
