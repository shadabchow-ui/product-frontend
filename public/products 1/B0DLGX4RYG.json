        "body": "This dress has a really nice concept — the long, flowy silhouette paired with the tube top style makes it feel airy and elegant. It definitely has potential as a warm-weather go-to or vacation outfit. However, the fabric quality doesn’t quite live up to the look. The material at the top is very sheer, which makes it hard to wear comfortably — it’s too transparent to go bra-less, but also not structured enough to wear with a bra without showing through. If you're creative with layering or undergarments, this could still work as a fun statement piece. This isn't necessarily bad, just something to be aware of when making the purchase. Read more",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Cocktail Maxi is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Black Apricot, Pink, White, Black Rose Red, Royal Blue, Black, Black White. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
