        "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best bodycon dress EVER!!!",
        "body": "I am so, so, so happy with this dress! I needed a dress to wear to my brothers wedding in Ireland this December and the one I originally bought is beautiful but it’s a pale blue color and the bride wants more dark colors so I ordered this dress in place of it. The reviews were glowing so after much deliberation regarding what size to order I went with the large instead of the x-large based on the reviews. I am sooooo glad that I did! I’m 5’6” and 180 pounds but my measurements are 41, 37, 41 so I fell in between sizes technically. I have a bigger bust but still decided that since I wanted a bodycon dress that hugs all my curves that I’d go with the smaller size. It fits PERFECTLY!!! The material is really nice and thick, the color is a rich navy and the length is perfect! Just long enough for the hem to touch the floor while wearing small heels. And the mermaid silhouette is gorgeous! Plus with the corset boning I don’t even need a bra with it! The first dress I ordered was also about $50 more expensive than this dress and I still have to get that one altered so this was the best dress for the money, the best choice for the occasion, the best fit that I could only imagine and it was delivered in record time. I ordered on a Friday morning and it was delivered on Monday night! The only issue I had with the dress was that the zipper kind of gets snagged at the spot where the two parts of the dress are sewn together but all it takes is patience and it will zip smoothly. I’m posting pictures also but I’m not wearing the heals and you can see the straps of my spanks lol. Sorry. I’ll post an update after the wedding in December!!! Read more",

        "body": "Wearing size Large | I’m 5’7” and ~180 lbs – Absolutely LOVE! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Perfect Wedding Guest Dress! I wore this dress to an end of summer wedding and got SO many compliments! The fit is very flattering—snug enough to give shape but still comfortable to move and dance in all night. The material has a nice weight to it, so it doesn’t feel cheap, and the floral print is elegant without being too loud. It has a beautiful corset top and ruching to help with any tummy control/camouflage needed!! What I really loved is how versatile it felt—formal enough for a wedding but not over-the-top, so I could definitely see myself wearing it to other events as well. The length was just right with heels, and the strapless neckline stayed in place (a big win since I didn’t have to keep adjusting it). If you’re looking for a dress that photographs beautifully, feels classy, and makes you feel confident, this one is a winner. Highly recommend! Read more",

The soft powder blue color is absolutely gorgeous in person — it’s fresh, romantic, and perfect for formal events or weddings without being too loud. The fit is perfection. The fabric has just the right amount of stretch to hug curves comfortably while still feeling secure. The ruching along the bodice and hips is incredibly flattering, smoothing everything out and giving a beautiful hourglass shape. The slight flare at the hem elongates the legs and makes walking feel graceful. I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it is to wear for hours — no digging straps or awkward bunching. It moves with you and photographs beautifully from every angle. I paired it with a small gold clutch and strappy heels, and I’ve never received so many compliments in one night.

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Evening Sleeveless Formal Bodycon Maxi Ruched is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nThe design is easy to style with simple accessories and works well in photos thanks to clean lines and a balanced silhouette.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.",

  "long_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Evening Sleeveless Formal Bodycon Maxi Ruched is a versatile piece you can reach for when you want a put-together look that still feels comfortable. The goal is simple: a silhouette that reads polished, photographs well, and stays wearable for a full day or a long night.\n\nFit and sizing Fit is where most outfits win or lose. This design aims for a balanced shape with a defined line through the torso, a clean waist, and a smooth finish through the hips and legs. If you prefer a more relaxed feel, size up; if you like a closer fit, stay true to size. Sizes may include: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11.\n\nFabric and comfort Comfort is not just about softness. It is also about movement and how the fabric behaves as you walk, sit, and stand. A fabric blend with a bit of give helps it keep its shape while still feeling wearable.\n\nHighlights A clean neckline and a refined silhouette for an elevated look. Designed to layer easily with jackets, wraps, or sweaters. Works well with both minimal accessories and statement pieces.\n\nHow to style Styling ideas: keep it minimal with neutral shoes and one standout accessory. For a relaxed daytime look, add a denim jacket or cardigan. For events, switch to a bolder shoe and a small clutch for a sharper finish.\n\nColor notes Available colors may include: Navy Print, Wine, Brown, Pink Floral, Black Floral, Blue, Mint, Purple Floral, Black Print, Black, Green Print, Dark Green, Red, Navy. If a shade is sold out, check back as availability can change.\n\nCare Care guidance matters if you want it to keep its shape and finish. Follow the label first.",
