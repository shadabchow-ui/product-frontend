I was comfortable when sitting for the ceremony and when I was out on the dance floor and the heavier velvet fabric flowed perfectly. I plan on wearing this same dress to a formal event and another wedding I have in January. Once I have this baby, I will be getting this one altered to fit my non-pregnancy body! Note: The V neck had a little peep hole, but nothing a little safety pin or needle and thread couldn't fix if you wanted to close the gap! Read more",

I would say this dress is true to size with stretch & the elastic waistline. It’s very comfy & fits in all the right places. The sleeves lay nicely and aren’t too snug. The button at the bust doesn’t gape. It’s low enough to offer a hint of boob while still feeling wedding-appropriate. I love how it feels when I’m in it & I honestly flitted around my house for an hour like Cinderella after I tried it on for the first time. The dark green is lovely. It’s a decent value for the price. I think it’s an excellent purchase that I’m genuinely excited to wear. Quality is decent for an Amazon buy. Its on the thicker side & feels just as soft and velvety as I hoped it would. Read more",

        "body": "This dress was gorgeous and as many have said, good quality. Unfortunately, i have huge boobs. Maybe even bigger than DDD, and the slit at the front gaped. I considered sewing up the gap but it would still be pretty low cut for the wedding i am going to. I found another style they have of this dress that is knee lenghty but fits my bust, has long sleeves and is just as gorgeous and less low cut. I recommend at least trying this dress because if it does fit, it is defintely worth the price. It made my waist look amazing and slim, which is often hard for me because i have a small waist and huge chest so finding something that sinches in at the waist and isnt too big there is usually hard. minus one star because they only go up to an Xl in this. an XXL would have probably solved my chest problems :) Read more",
