        "body": "Bought this in both the navy and burgundy to compare, as I needed a guest dress to wear to a wedding; the burgundy ended up being the best color for me, but rest assured, both fit the same exact way. This dress is a dupe of a Betsy & Adam dress. It isn’t lined, but the B&A dress is only lined in the respect that their fabric has a backer (you can still see the inside seams though), so not much of a difference — and the price of this one is much less than the B&A. I was very pleased with the quality, and it looked good on. The fabric is thick enough that I did not need to wear a shaper, but you can if you want. I wore my regular bra with it just fine! Also, the length is great for petite women because the back touches the floor while the front is slightly raised/split to offer a glimpse of leg. For tall ladies, the back will be ankle length. Because of the split/raise in the front, both floor and ankle length works well for petite and tall women. I love that I did not need to get it hemmed; I’m 5’4” and wore 2.75 inch heels and it was perfect for me. While form fitting, it does not accentuate the stomach because of the twist and ruffle design on the front, which is wonderful. My only concern: the twist part starts high up on the bodice. I am long-waisted, and it would have looked better on me if that twist started a little lower under the bust and more mid-waist. Other than that, 5/5 stars. Read more",

It’s definitely true to size, but not skin tight like you might expect, which makes it more flattering. The material is on the thicker side and slightly stretchy for reference. 10/10! Read more",

I was able to wear a normal bra with it.....I steamed it upon receiving it just to get the wrinkles out from where it was folded for shipping and they came out beautifully. I wore it all night to a semi formal ball....standing up and sitting down multiple times with out it wrinkling once. Prior to ordering it I was worried about how the ruching and gathering on the side would look when I took it out of the package but it looked beautiful! And the ruching hides the belly area perfectly, no body shaper or anything needed to wear underneath to flatten the belly. 5'3\", 120lbs, size small was perfect for me with a pair of heels (heel height 2.7\"). However if my heels were any shorter the dress might have brushed the floor. I got the purple.....such a beautiful dark shade. I am sure I will order again in a different color for other occasions.

  "short_description": "Womens Maxi Dress Evening Split Sleeveless Formal V Neck is made for a polished look that still feels comfortable to wear. It is designed to sit cleanly on the body with a flattering shape that works for day plans and dressier moments without feeling overdone.\n\nThe fit focuses on balance rather than extremes, so you can move naturally while still getting a defined silhouette. Choose your usual size for a closer look, or size up if you prefer a little more ease through the waist and hips.\n\nStyling is simple: keep accessories minimal for a clean finish, or add a jacket and statement shoes when you want a sharper outfit. This piece photographs well thanks to smooth lines and a structured feel that stays put once you have it adjusted.\n\nWith the right fit and simple styling, this item becomes an easy go-to when you want something that looks intentional without requiring extra effort.\n\nTo keep it looking sharp, follow the care label first and avoid high heat when drying or steaming if the material is sensitive.\n\nFor the best look, smooth the fabric, check the neckline placement, and pair it with shoes that match the occasion and the hem length.",
